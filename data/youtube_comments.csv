About electric hand brake. I have Nconnecta model so I can say that it doesn't have that. Instead it has a foot pedal break and it works by pressing the pedal down (and also releases by pressing it down). Is it still hand brake if you use it with your foot? I don't know. But it works very well and it never goes on or off by itself. It is all manual.,@user-pz8sf8rb8i,0,2024-04-21T18:00:50Z
Plenty of smarty-pants negative comments on here but these are mainly by know-all types and best to ignore. I use the Leaf for short journeys and town driving for which it is a real winner. Home charging means I am saving big bucks.,@jaxthename,1,2024-04-17T21:10:06Z

"I'm thinking of trying either a late 30kwh gen1 or early gen2 leaf on my parents. They are getting on and increasingly use their small car for very short trips, less than a mile and a half each way. They used to walk most of the time but aren't so capable of that now. The small petrol car they have doesn't even fully warm up, sometimes for several trips in a row and as a result is causing the warning light to come on. They never take it more than about 30 miles from home either and rarely that far, so an 80 mile range and only home charging is no problem. An electric motor doesn't care how short your journeys are. 
The only problem is my Dad won't have one because it wouldn't be capable of a theoretical journey that he hasn't been on in the last 15 years and never will go on anyway, but he will have a petrol car even though it is likely to mean some huge bills in the future when the catalytic converter dies due to the useage.",@bazzacuda_,2,2024-03-29T00:57:46Z

"A more balanced review of a fairly modern car regardless of the power source.

A vehicle with a reliable 150 miles even in winter is more than sufficient for 95% of drivers.  The average car use per day is around 20 miles in the UK and most people do not go on journeys of over 100 miles with any sort of regularity.

We have an EV.  It's not a Nissan though it has similar battery capacity and motor power but will do more real miles than the Nissan does.   Our everyday need is low but round trips with an oldie to the hospital can result in 80 plus mile days.

We now have the ability to charge on cheap juice overnight even though we live in a Victorian terrace.  Local authorities are slowly but surely making this happen.

I love cars and my all time favourite is the Ford Anglia 123E Super with the 1200cc engine.  We had a 1967 vintage version and I loved everything about that car.   To be brutally honest though in the modern world a modern car is so much safer and more practical.",@michaelgoode9555,2,2024-02-02T10:32:21Z

"Chademo is an actual standard whereas CCS has variations between manufacturers. Chademo is also designed with V2G in mind and V2G/V2H functionality was mandated for Japanese manufactured EVs in the wake of Fukushima as is presents the potential for EVs to provide grid resilience by acting en-masse as a utility scale grid storage facility.

We're onto our second Leaf (2012 24kWh, 2016 30kWh) and use of public charging is virtually nil for us. The upgrade was actually done last year with V2G very much in mind as we have solar and I'm hesitant to spend money on a static battery when a Leaf can do the job plus provide mobility.

Some very interesting info to be had in Robert Llewellyn's interview of David Slutzky of Fermata Energy on V2G's potential in electricity supply resilience and gaining income from your Leaf by way of their bidirectional charging functionality. Worth noting also that EV manufacturers are reacting to V2G demand and are now increasingly incorporating this in their vehicles, but the humble Leaf has had this almost from its debut.",@HarmLessSolutionsNZ,1,2024-01-27T01:18:08Z
"As far as cold weather goes ... the 2019 LEAF we bought two months ago has just been through a week of sub-minus-30 weather. (I live in Saskatchewan, because I am insane.) Never needs a boost, the cabin heats up in five minutes compared to 20-30 for the old Civic. The range isn't great even with the 62kWh battery, probably 150km in that bitter cold, but we're not regular highway drivers so it's just fine - and that's a worst case range, worse than worst-case for you Brits. Plug it into the side of the house at night, it's charged in the morning and you really don't need more than that. Best winter city driving car I've ever owned.

"I've had a 2014 Leaf (24kWh) since 2019 and it was the most expensive second hand car I've ever bought (£7,500). But 4½ years later it's paid for its purchase price in fuel savings alone compared to the 2005 Honda Civic it replaced. In October we had a V2H (Vehicle to Home) charger fitted and now I can charge it on cheap overnight electricity and use it as a battery to power my house (and soak up free power from my solar panels). For our family it's the gift that keeps on giving.

It's a great daily driver, like you said it's not exciting but it's very competent and it only costs us 2.3p/mile if we charge at home (we get a lot of free solar miles in the Summer too).

The bump in the middle of the rear floor is where the high voltage emergency disconnect lives, in the event of an accident the emergency services can pop it open and remove a plug to isolate the battery.

"EVs are a technology going nowhere, in my opinion. 
The charging hassles are one of many problems. I see batteries as the cursing factor, with many aspects. Unless battery technology makes massive advances in the near future, EVs are a big failure. Winter, heating the car electrically is a disaster especially if you get stuck in any way. The tendency for batteries to burst into flame must be cured, at minimum some way of predicting the risk. Power storage is far to small. The batteries require relatively large amounts of rare earth minerals, these will be harder and harder to find, so a way of making batteries that store more energy without the minerals, a huge technology jump..

Apparently the same applies if you let the battery go below 20%. In which case the useable range is actually 60% of its real range, which in turn is probably 85% of the manufacturer's claimed range. I have solar panels at home so of course when the sun shone on them I plugged it in. You would, wouldn't you?

99% of the time mine is always charged at home overnight so it's very cheap to run.

It’s a lovely car and very convenient and cost effective to run. Recently I’ve been looking at a Polestar on a scheme through my work. With a wall box I could keep it charged at home no problems with fuel costs being a little lower than the diesel Mercedes. What puts me off is the charging network away from home. Last year we did a road trip to Scotland in a PHEV car. We couldn’t find anywhere to charge the battery. Domestic supplies tripped out on the 3 pin plug, service area chargers were all in use, we found a bank of empty chargers but you needed an app to use them and there was no mobile internet to download the app…..Luckily we had the option of just running on petrol so did that instead.",@alansorbie4038,7,2024-01-20T22:06:13Z

There’s a place for both EVs and ICE and I think that’s the issue, at the moment with the current battery technology, EVs cannot replace ICE  for long journeys but for the cities they are perfect. Now the problem is EVs are getting bigger and bigger requiring bigger battery packs and you’d could argue that’s not an efficient use of resources. Small and light would be the way to go for use in cities. At the moment, it seems that plug in hybrids would be the best of both worlds, smaller battery packs with a range of 50 or so KM with the ability to hold the charge for city use. That range would suit most people’s daily driving and you have the ICE for longer trips then there’s no need for 90kwh of expensive and heavy batteries - a better use of resources cheaper and the ability to get more of them on the road.",@Lobo-ih3bh,22,2024-01-20T21:10:11Z

"so much politics, so little time... I don't get it. Nobody seems to connect the dots.
I fervently believe in global warming and I like the idea of electric cars (I drive a dual fuel car and rely on LPG which is more environmentally friendly but the British government, after allowing grants for vehicle conversion subsequently forgot about LPG and so the associated fuel stations are all going… except in Europe where people think differently). 
It’s an uncoordinated mess.
 There is no way that the infrastructure to support mass EV conversion is going to happen without huge (unforeseen!) issues . The figures don't add up and even if they did there are one or two (or twelve) issues left unaddressed:
The harvesting of the required rare earths from the bottom of the sea for battery manufacture and the environmental impact is just one issue left unfaced. 
The emerging danger of electric vehicle fires is another. 
Lots of people don't live in houses suitable for EV cars. Great if you have your own drive. Not so much if you don’t.

"We were told recently that you break even with emissions at 70,000 mile or 7 years. BUT, we need to consider that the battery will require changing shortly after this time period, at a cost of over £10,000 in most cases. Some cars are requiring batteries early, some later. But for me Ian, it has to be insurance. Insurance companies are writing these cars (EV cars) off with very minor damage. One chap just had a slightly scuffed floor and it was completely written off because the insurance company couldn't tell if the battery had been compromised. Also, why are we seeing so many EV cars catching fire? One poor lady lost her entire house in the States, because her rental Mercedes caught fire and took her house with it. I like the idea of EV cars, but I find them stressful. Is it going to catch fire? Is the insurance going to be too expensive? Am I going to be landed with a huge bill for a new battery?

"If that car had a CCS charging port, it would be a far, far more practical alternative. Though UK charging structure still needs quite a bit of development.

I stuck to my old, very high kilometreage VW Golf IV for the longest of times here in Norway, until it finally just became too expensive to keep it on the road and have it pass MOTs. Thankfully, that coincided with the charging infrastructure really being up to snuff, and after watching lots of very thorough EV tests done by Bjørn Nyland here on YouTube, I felt more than comfortable about making the switch. I think something like 82 % of new cars sold here in Norway last year were EVs (though I bought a demo car from a dealer), so buying an EV here is about as common as...drinking water, really.",@hadtopicausername,2,2024-01-20T16:30:38Z

"It's a good thing that there's many cottage industries out there who serve to keep theses cars on the road where Nissan has failed. The passive cooling of the LEAF's battery is such an utter shame. At the modular level the ability to self balance is also poorly engineered, squandered even of what should be an accessible and affordable EV.

It's partly the reason why LEAFs depreciate more than Citroen CZeros/Mitsubishi iMiEVs, their batteries are less stressed and live easier lives.

"Nissan Leaf owners who have cars less than 8 years old- and in many cases WELL under 100,000 kms are having to scrap their cars because there is currently no repair nor replacement batteries available for them. 

Imagine a customer buying an electric vehicle believing that they are saving the environment only to find that their vehicle is considered scrap after less than 60,000 miles and 8 year’s worth of service. 

Most gas powered cars in production today should EASILY make it to over 200,000 kms and 15 years worth of use. As for other electric vehicles, the general consensus is that the vehicles are scrap once the battery is worn out because at that point, a replacement battery and the installation will surpass the value of the vehicle. Yes, there are some makes and models that provide better life from their vehicles, but those are offset by the ones that are write-offs because of what should be relatively simple repairs or battery failure.",@jaymiller6009,0,2024-03-20T14:25:18Z
"This guy barely knows what he's talking about. He did find and grab a very degraded Leaf, but that's not super common or a good example of what someone would drive with a battery that degraded without planning to replace the battery already. Someone who had no plan of replacing the battery would look for one with little degradation. There are plenty of people who have upgraded the 2011 Leaf to a used 40kwh battery for 3-5k (120-150 mile range). Even people who have NEVER worked on cars before have done the battery swap in driveways. For a little more you can upgrade to a 62kwh battery as well, and get around 200 miles, sometimes more.

The Leaf not having thermal management is actually the main reason there have been almost 0 Leaf battery fires. If the thermal management fails in the slightest in a Tesla, that's usually when you get Tesla fires if the design of their batteries get too hot.

The future Leaf's are possibly switching to Lithium Iron Posphate which those type of batteries degrade a LOT less (last about 20 years), and can take a beating in terms of heat better as well. Also Lithium Iron Posphate batteries are literally not flammable, like Lithium ION or Lithium Cobolt (which is no longer made already due to the negative environmental impacts) which are both EXTREMELY EXTREMELY flammable. Another option in the makes by Toyota is Solid State Batteries which same is leaps and bounds better than Lithium ION.",@ToastyToastiness,0,2024-03-18T17:12:38Z

"That's why I did my due diligence before purchasing my Leaf. 
In the 80s I went for a ride in a converted ICE vehicle and was sold on the concept. 
I waited until the lizard battery came out. I found one that had all the battery bars for less than $10,000 in 2016. I was told I couldn't make long trips, but I did make a trip of 1,600  miles, round trip, early on.
The Leaf is now 10 years old with over 126,000 miles and 25% degradation. At this point I don't take long trips and 50 miles is more than adequate for my needs as a retiree. I was looking to the future when I wouldn't drive as much. Most driving is 12 to 24 miles a day. It may be the last car I own. 
It's a great little car for charging at home and local traveling. 
The new Leaf has longer range and would make a less expensive alternative here in the Northwest. 
I don't see a battery swap as totaling the vehicle,  but as a being a less expensive alternative to buying a new car. I don't view an item that loses value year after year an investment.

You can of course upgrade the battery pack to get more range, if you can find a third-party shop that does those conversions using a battery pack from a later model salvage vehicle, but you have to get that done at the right price to justify doing that instead of just buying another used EV with better range like a Chevy Bolt or maybe an early Model S.",@aftonline,1,2024-01-26T11:41:25Z

"I think you missed the *other* major, expensive fault with these cars: the On Board Charger.

The 2010-2013 Leaf on-board charger is known to fail and is an expensive fix. If you're lucky and have the know-how, it can be repaired cheaply with a bit of work, but a full replacement is over $3k.

When the on board charger fails, you can only charge the car on DC ChaDeMo. You won't be able to charge at home.

Otherwise a fair review. I have a 2012 Leaf, which I bought in July last year. It has just dropped to 9 bars. So far so good with it. It does help that it is from a cooler climate (Canberra, Australia) and only has 53,000km on the clock. Now that it's in Sydney it's degrading mildly faster but it only does occasional short trips now.

Love mine, but agree that the first gen leaf should be avoided. And the fact that new leafs STILL come with no thermal management and ChaDeMo is appalling, which is why when we bought our new EV this year we picked the BYD Atto 3 (which has been fabulous). It's a pity, because the Nissan is the OG, it's the grand daddy, and it is damn well built.

Oh, the heater in the Leaf is grossly inefficient. It'll sap range something fierce. I've seen mine draw 4500 Watts, compared to my Atto's heat pump drawing a little over 1000 at worst.",@nadnerb2k,0,2023-12-07T05:38:12Z

"I argue that it’s not a fundamental flaw, it’s the premise that the early leaf does not meet American consumer specifications. That is, we want long range and are so ideologically dependent on gas. I have put 40k on my 2012 through commuting to Ann Arbor with Michigan winters with zero issues. It’s close to 75k now. On average I spend $15 dollars a month on subsidized electricity in Anna arbor. Secondly, if I were to be unable to leave my rural area because of a bad winter, well then I pull out my  2021 4 runnerTRD Pro. Thus, 95% of my driving annually, is done by the leaf and saving me a tremendous amount of money. I literally save more money having a gas powered car on storage insurance rate with an EV versus if I were to drive my 4runner daily at $70 a tank of gas weekly. Great show! But a separate analysis needs to be conducted relative to your daily commute audience—the leaf is not designed for long road trips, hence it meets its purpose to save money for your normal commutes and even in austere weather. Also, the front wheel drive does just fine in heavy snow. Just slap some all weather tires for about $60 a piece.

"Owning 2013 Leaf S with Chademo since 2020 in Ukraine, did 28k miles on it already. All time with A/C on, without ECO and without 'slow driving', just enjoying the car. When bought it was 83.5% SOH (18kw/h usable) and now 76% SOH (16.8kw/h ~ usable). 99% of time charge to 100% but never was discharging it to 'turtle' state, never left it even for a day being charged to 100% or discharged less than 20%, like 99% of charges made at home with 220V with it's own brick (which charges around 2.2kw/h). The only problem I was experiencing - it's suspension. Car has 86000 miles on it by this time.

Big part missed is difference between 2011-2012 and 2013-2017 cars and of course the one with 30kwt battery. ZE0 - 11-12', AZE0 - 13-17', BZE0 - 13-17' but with 30kwt.
ZE0 is the worst one, it looks identical visually but technically it's just another car, another battery chemistry (and another battery case/connections as well), another motor, another charger, another wiring, just really different car and it's degradation yeah, not good at all + charger is known to be 'fried' and find a replacement is an expensive headache, in fact any spare part which is different from AZE0 is hard and expensive to find.
But starting from AZE0 it's really different, battery much more reliable (as for me my stats are not bad and I've seen plenty of better ones here with same age), charger is reliable and can handle up to 6.6kw/h AC (seems as a joke nowdays but it's better than default 3.3), anything not related to battery/bodywork is quite easy and cheap to find (maybe except suspension, even though it's simple it still quite pricy), heater works like immediately + if it is a SV/SL trim you get efficient heat pump which reduces power usage for heating approx by 15-20%.

For most people in US I guess car under 10k is not a thing so Leaf should be avoided in this case but if you have only up to 8k for a car, charge plug at home and it fits your range - it is just pefrect. Air cooling will be a problem only for extreme hot temperatures and if you are using more than 1 DC charge in a row. For all time all problems I had is with suspension (I guess our shity roads also aaffected it :D) and that's it, after fixing suspension it became just perfect for my needs again. Next one will be tesla for sure but that's some time later.

P.s. As for BZE0 (the one with 30kwt pack) should be avoided at all costs, Nissan really failed with software and these cars were degrading super fast because of it, they had a campaign but not a lot of cars been 'updated' since you can't just do it by yourself as in Tesla, a lot of cars still on old firmware + after update battery still already degraded, in other parts - it's the same as AZE0.",@oleksiikobzar5727,0,2023-11-16T13:33:59Z

"Hello, by having a vehicle over 10 years old and a battery with a gross capacity of 24Kwh for 21Kwh useful, with more than 100,000km, there is a way to have a battery that is quite worn out...


The manufacturers make guarantees which can indicate the probable degradation of the battery, for the leaf 24Kwh is 5 years or 100000Km, we can therefore deduce with this guarantee that the maximum loss of capacity over 5 years is 30%.
If the loss of capacity is linear, we would have a 60% loss of capacity, fortunately this is not the case, we must rather be at a 45% loss of capacity. With a typical average consumption of 15Kwh/100Km, we can conclude that with the remaining 10 to 12Kwh, we can travel 77Km by draining the battery, moreover what I indicate is quite close to what you have on the meter.

For a vehicle with such degradation it is preferable to change the battery with one having a larger capacity and recycle the old one into a stationary battery.

This vehicle is therefore good to buy, as long as we know what we are going to do, so to say that we should not buy is a total mistake.

"You should make a correction to this video because these vehicles are actually not air-cooled, they are passively cooled there's a difference.

Air cooled cars have better radiators and fans to assist in forced air induction, like the Nissan ENV200. Whilst passively cooled EVs simply radiate heat through the cars body (think heat radiation through the chassis, metal plates or special ""cooling skin"") or through a basic radiator with no fans, as the leaf does.

In other country's they're trying out a subscription program for batteries. If there were a program here to change out Leaf batteries and others like it, one could extend the usefulness of these vehicles. The overall structure of the car is in immaculate condition, why cut short the life of the car when the power plant is bad when you can have something last for as long as some of these (ICE) vehicles that have over 100000 miles. And with those types of cars you just replace the engine and it goes again.

If these cars get short-range and you're planning a longer trip just pop into one of these exchange places and get a new battery for an extended journey.

I'm thinking of this car in mind and the BMW i3 and practically any other car that can get you less than 200 miles of range.

The whole family loves it, and now my son drives it to college every day, and the battery is still at 80% of its original capacity.  The realistic 100% range is still 70+ miles.  This is surely helped by the mild weather here and the fact that we always limit the charge to 80%.  If you do your research, you can get a great first EV / commuter car with a used Leaf.

"I think we are going to find this to be common with all EV's as they get to be 10-15 years old, even with low mileage.   Batteries degrade even if you do not drive them much.   We see this with everything in our lives be it laptops, phones.   The battery life and replacement really needs to be factored into the ""maintenance"" and long term ownership of these cars.   Not everyone buys a new car every 3-5 years and many of us can only afford used ones that are 5+ years old and keep them for many years afterwards.  This whole ""lower cost of maintenance"" for the early years of EV's is really just a myth for people that have this cars, even low mileage cars, as they age.

"Loved my Leaf.  Taking care of that battery is key.  Slow AC charge it, keep it out of the sun and heat as much as you can and the batteries will live a lot longer.  The price to replace these batteries is still very high and while you can get a larger capacity battery for them the cost will still be questionable.  One of the glaring deficiencies in the EV market are the shops that do the repairs.  It is a problem that is only going to grow.  Insurance companies too often are salvaging vehicles because they can't get them recertified and repaired so they write them off.  The new Leaf being sold today is still air cooled.  I don't know what changes Nissan has made to address the degradation in the currently sold new cars, but I don't hear as much complaining today.  It is dead end technology.  Nissan needs a serious update to this car which it does not appear they will be doing. 

While not a good idea to DCFC these things much to add insult to injury the DCFC plug is Chademo so there aren't as many places to charge when away.  You have to make sure the Leaf is even equipped with the DCFC plug because it wasn't standard equipment until later.   If you only drive local short distances, can keep the vehicle garaged and out of the heat, and AC slow charge it the Leaf with a new battery would still work for people, but that is a lot of conditions to be met for it to make sense now.",@Longsnowsm,8,2023-08-28T12:45:17Z
"Good news about the Nissan Leaf. I own both a 15 and a 16 Nissan Leaf. the 15 has 54K and still has 11 bars. It was from the San Francisco area and was never DC fast charged. My wife and I live in the Washington State and my wife will drive this Leaf all day long and still go over 80 miles in her daily commutes. If She uses freeway only, the range will degrade to about 60. Around town is the key. For example, our newer 16 Leaf has 43K on it and still has all 12 battery life meter bars. If I drive around town and no freeway. I can go over 90 miles on one charge.  It's an amazing bargain if you have a secondary vehicle for out of town trips, only use the Leaf for daily short commutes, and then plug in at home with a level 1 or 2 charger.

Major downside to the Leaf and the reason I didn't get one is the Chademo rapid charger connection. Even Nissan are ditching it in favour of the CCS rapid charger. This means that going forward you will struggle to find decent Chademo chargers. Perfect example of this is that my local BP has just fitted 150kW chargers and none of them have Chademo chargers.

Not sure on the Leaf but my model 3 can use Octopus Intelligent with a 3pin plug as the car/app controls the charge. Gives me 7.5p rate and around a minimum of about 55 miles a night but often more as they give bonus time as well. More than enough for me and I think most. Saves the roughly £1000 of a charger install. It would take me years to break even on the cost of the charger.,@usefulrandom1855,2,2024-04-01T12:45:17Z

"Good to see a new vid from you after all this time. Interesting to see the costs in the uk. In New Zealand the government has just changed the rules over EVs, and EV owners now need to pay road user charges, and get no rebates when purchasing a new EV. So EV owners have to pay tax  for each km they travel ,to pay for the roads. Whereas petrol car owners pay this tax in the fuel cost, so don't need to pay per km. So it doesn't really work out any cheaper to own an EV, and with increasing electricity prices, it will likely be more expensive, especially if using charging stations.

"Last year we got a 12-bar Nissan Leaf from 2014 that had done 60k miles. Treat it right and it will last. As for electricity, we were on a British gas standard tariff at 30p pkwh but they do an ev tariff from 12 to 5am for 10p a kwh so we moved to that (12 till 5 for anything electric not justy a car) . So there are savings to be had if you can change. It can do 90 miles on a full charge in summer but we use it for journeys of 30 miles each way max and it's fine (winter did see a 20% drop overall in the number of miles we got on a charge) with a nice drive.

"House seems to be looking nice Jake.
As for the car , you need to dump whatever you have been told or think you know about fast charging damaging batteries as you are very mistaken.
You will have no issues using fast chargers while you are out and about on longer journeys.
Use your charger at home overnight to charge fully and charge out and about on fast chargers on your IKEA trips between 20 and 80 % .. it's pointless going above that as the charge speed drops dramatically once you get to 80% .. and in fact the battery likes to be at least decent temperature before you start charging to get the better speeds.
If it does get too hot , the car will simply drop the charging speed.

I know people that have exclusively fast charged on public chargers and have done 100-150k plus mileage and never once slow home charged .. I exclusively use public fast chargers with my i-pace as I can't charge at home and have no battery issues.

There is a lot of wrong information being spread around about EV charging and it's not helpful at all.

Interesting video that was quite honest but I do have to disagree with you when you got to the charge times of the car and continued to say welcome to the future. The Nissan leaf is most definitely not the future it really is a re bodied mark 1 leaf with a bigger battery. All the switch gear seats and door cards are lifted straight from the first generation. Great as a second car at a sensible used price. But with the no CCS connector and limited 45 to 50 KW charge speed it’s not the future. Cars like the Kia EV6  or Hyundai Ioniq 5 are a better representation  of the future with its 800 volt architecture and 250 KW charging speeds charger dependent and CCS CONNECTION.,@stephenclay6852,0,2023-04-13T15:39:07Z
"I bought a 2 year old teckna from a Nissan main dealer a couple of years ago. It had 15k on the clock. Despite it having a full charge, by the time I had made the 15 mile trip home it had almost run out of charge. Must just be me, I thought, so I charged it up and used it on the school run the next morning. We had just moved so the school run was 21 miles. At 20 miles I had to go to economy mode or we wouldn't have made it. I rang Nissan and returned the car less than 24 hours after picking it up, they hadn't even sent off the paperwork.
That experience has really put me off EV's and I couldn't justify buying one as a main car. As Matt mentions, spending tens of thousands on a second car for what is essentially a local runaround, is too much for me.",@danielearley5062,0,2023-04-13T14:36:01Z

It's almost a purely financial decision for me because 1. It's dropped most of it's value from new and I intend to run it for 8+ years 2. I can get 10p per KWH on OVO which makes it 2-3p per mile 3. Servicing costs are v low 4. There is very little to go wrong with it so I hope it will be more reliable.  5. It's ready for vehicle to grid when the UK starts allowing that.  Hopefully in 2025.  Those who have done that already through trials can make c£800 a year by selling energy back to the grid when it is more expensive.  My wife and I will share it and whoever is driving most that day will take it as long as they're not driving 200 miles+ in a day which seems highly unlikely.

"Bear in mind this is probably the WORST EV you can get for any amount of money. It is overpriced, dining out on past glories, air cooled rubbish battery management, Nissan still persists with the almost extinct ""chademo"" charging connector. There are plenty of better alternatives, both new and second-hand.  Primarily Tesla, simply because you get so much bang for your buck - not least a mature reliable and effortless widespread charging network. Big Battery Teslas will charger at 250kw and smaller battery ones manage 180kw. This is extremely fast. Then MG have three great options - the MG ZS, MG5 (estate) and the new MG4 Hatch. All three are compelling with that ""everything"" 7 year warranty. I had a very very close look at the new generation Fiat 500 EV last summer and it was an absolutely fantastic little car  though not sure if the battery management is similar to the Nissan - at least it does have CCS charging as standard. 
You mentioned the Leaf is forty grand and I checked the top spec biggest battery item is now £36.5k probably as a result of the recent Tesla price drops. Kia and Hyundai are also worth looking at but be careful to interrogate the dealers about the cost of servicing - the 40k service is the thick end of a Grand - and for what exactly?

"I think this really highlights the issue with EVs.  If you do plenty of miles and hence you need a (half) decent range then you will be looking at the SUV types which must be 3-500KG heavier than an equivalent car using dinosaur fuelled vehicle just in battery weight.  Simple laws of physics indicate that this is going to use more energy as this is proportional to the weight moved.
So buying one of these for environmental reasons does not hold water as you have said.  Unfortunatly too many owners confuse the financial cost of their energy with the amount of energy used, conveniently forgetting that a high proportion of the cost of dino' fuel is tax.

If you only do a few miles then one of the smaller cars may be just fine (as long as you're not doing if for environmental reasons) but if you're only doing a few miles per trip is it really worth paying the premium?  It seems these kind of cars carry a premium of around £15,000.  
Quick bit of math's
£15,000 = 10,000 Litres of fuel assuming £1.5/L, I actually see it's quite a bit below this at my local ASDA 
10,000L = 2200  Imperial gallons (the proper full size ones rather than the short measures they get in the US of A)
Lets assume we get a really inefficient petrol car which will only average 30MPG, that will take you 66,000 miles 
So even if the electric was free you'd be at least 7 years older before you break even.

I agree there is a lot to like about the driving characteristics of EVs and if that's what is leading the purchasing decision fair enough, but much as I like a bit of peace and quiet I'd miss the sound of a petrol engine (even some Diesels) particularly one with the correct number of cylinders (which of course is 8).",@brendanmccabe8769,0,2023-04-11T13:25:08Z

I tried driving a tesla initially as a normal car but the throttle was like an on off switch because it didn't coast,  it was awful for passengers and me.

For around town runaround’s this is the perfect car, the boot is huge. For motorway it’s …. Not.

"My parents got one through the mobility scheme in the UK.   The larger battery version has a pronounced box in the boot which made it really difficult fitting in their wheelchair and other bits needed to move around.    They went for the lesser range one because 90% of the time they just use it around the city where it's excellent.    Holidays however, have become very stressful.   So much so, they rarely drive away on holiday any more due to range anxiety and the plethora of apps required for charging stations in the UK.    They find that once they're out of the city finding working charge points is difficult and managing the apps just isn't easy enough.    I think the infrastructure just isn't there to support ev's as an only vehicle and that's disappointing given how much encouragement is being offered to move to them.

Now back to the latest instalment of my autobiography :
 I did help look after four BMW i3's at a lux retirement village 5 years ago. They were for self drive hire or we would drive residents if two Audi saloons or the minibus were out. I LOVED the one foot braking on that model, and would have bought one if funds ever allowed. I drove an I-Pace once, terrible suspension, control, and a Tesla X something but that's about it.

"My biggest issues with EV’s is longevity and how “green” they are.

If the battery needs replacing outside of warranty it effectively writes the car off. I’ve heard it costs €20,000 for a replacement battery on a Tesla, so it’s probably considerably more on a Mercedes or BMW.

I also find the idea that EV’s are the solution to transport emissions infuriating. At best they produce the same amount of greenhouse gases in production as a normal car at 150,000 miles and at that point the battery needs replacing, adding more greenhouse gases.

As a result EV’s get seen more as white goods that get scrapped every 6-10 years which would lead to a rise in EV production ergo making transport emissions worse than if we stuck with petrol/diesels.",@TheSchleepingmoney,0,2023-04-10T20:56:16Z

This is something many will not admit to but race plays a crucial factor. White women generally are not into brown or dark skin. People prefer their own race and that's just how it is. I have to accept that sadly but this is the major reason as to why I'm single. 

It may not be too late to meet someone but I haven't even come close to being in a relationship for years now. I rarely even meet someone I want to pursue. The few I do aren't into me and the ones that are, I'm not into. There always seems to be something missing. I very rarely get a mutual match on hinge and other dating apps. Meanwhile, people around me are getting together slowly and although there are others in my situation, I am worried about being left on the shelf and being alone for the rest of my life. I don't want to continue living if that's the case. I've tried to lower my standards but that's the worst possible strategy, pretending and forcing yourself to like someone you know you're not into.

"Another great and sincere review Thanks Matt.

I work on many brands of cars, I've driven many EV's and can say without a doubt that the Leaf is my favorite EV, Some like the Telsa are way over priced and so boring, I'm not sold on the idea of only one power source, I think we should all have a choice, EV owners seem to think that petrol and diesel should go away completely, I think that would be a massive mistake, Cars can easily live 30 years with proper maintenence, so why be forced to scrap them down the road, That's a very negative thing to do in the Tree hugging world we live in, kinda like the scrappage scheme where good cars got scrapped for no reason but a Govt pay off. 

I love how so many EV owners leave a comment about Loving not having to stop at a petrol station, yet so many on You Tube stop to charge up their EV and grab a coffee and use the toilet, These people make no sense at all, everybody has to use a toilet sometime and the love for coffee has gone through the roof, Charging an EV on the motorway is no different to stopping to fill up with petrol except it takes longer.
 
I'm sure Id hate plugging in my car every night just in case I needed to go out further a field the next day.

What I really hate is the push from EV owners to try and convince the rest of us that we need an EV, they come across so crass, with positive reviews, the act like they know it all, 
They never seem to bring up range anxiety, they used to tell us how cheap it was to charge up their cars, that seems to have died off now with today's electricity rates, and still they insist and are convinced the price of Electricity will go down, To me that defies all logic, They can install as many wind farms and Solar panels as they want but the price of Electricity will not be falling, the electricity companies will see to that.   

T.B.H. Id be happy to buy a Hydrogen car 5-10 years down the road,  that looks so positive to me and yes the infrastructure has to improve just like with EV chargers.

"Hi Matt, I test-drove a Jaguar i-pace the other day, it was a 2018 plate with 39,000 miles on the clock. I loved the car but then I did a little more research work. I discovered that the car had depreciated over half of its list price in less than five years ( approx £29,000 ) more than a similarly priced petrol/diesel equivalent. The battery is only covered for 8 years of manufacturer warranty !!!!!! so in three years if the battery died I would have to pay approximately £8000 - £ 10000 for a new one. The tax incentives that the government initially gave to get everybody into an EV are slowly being taken away and are now saying that from 2025 all-electric cars will have to pay VED at the standard road tax rate furthermore the little government help to have home wall chargers installed is no longer available.

"Nice mini review - but a few points worthy of note.

The charge lead not fitting is not a thing, or at least, not as you glossed over. The charge leads you carry in the car are all Type-2 connectors for fast (not rapid) charging, and they will fit every Type 2 Fast charger out there - i.e. all of them. The Leaf does, however, use Chademo rapid charging, and that is rarer than the more common CCS rapid chargers, though most rapid charger locations will have at least one or two Chademo capable chargers - the leads on a rapid charger are permanently attached to the charger, and not carried in the car. Is it an issue? Yes, it does limit your options a little as to where to head for a rapid charge - it's worth using an App such as Zap Map to locate suitable chargers - but then that's like charging any other EV (other than Tesla with their own Supercharging network).

Range on the 60kwh version: - we drive a 40kwh version, and our achievable range is around 130 miles in the winter, and just over 150 miles in the summer. Given that there is 50% more capacity in the 60kwh (59) version, 190 miles in the winter and around 225 in the summer seems like a reasonable assumption to make.

Ours is on just a 2 year lease - this was us dipping our toe in the EV water to see how we got on - like others, we were concerned that the range wouldn't be enough, and we weren't prepared to fork out on an expensive lease (iPace, EQC etc.) as a taster.

I can say though, that the experience has been great. Much of your review is spot on - it's not a car that feels particularly special. The level of trim is just OK, even in the 'top spec' Tekna - it's not somewhere I love to be - but it is acceptable as a day to day workhorse. My wife, a GP, uses it for the most part, and tends to do a daily commute, plus house visits of 60-70 miles - and for this, it's ideal. Also, as it doesn't scream 'pretentious' , no-one gives it a second glance.

Cost to run? Well, the lease we have costs less than the diesel we were burning in a V60 as my wife's previous car per month. And charging overnight means our cost per mile is just over 2p! Compare that to our XC90, which costs 26p per mile in diesel alone!

If I were to use a rapid charger however, the cost shoots up to nearer 20p a mile - comparable to a diesel estate. But no-one I know consistently charges their EV at a rapid charger - everyone either charges overnight on a cheap tariff, or, worst case, charges at the standard rate - which still equates to around half the price of running a diesel vehicle. Anyone that might not have access to their own electricity supply should look elsewhere until the charging infrastructure is there; at the moment, the operators of rapid chargers are price gouging because they can. Once charging points and rapid chargers become more prolific, the pricing should stabilise at a much lower level.

I'm sure there will be a few (many?) petrol head luddites, who will say in the comments that they will never have an EV, as they're committed to driving their gas guzzling V8's (or more likely 4-pot Fiesta) and they can do 800 miles on a tank of dinosaurs. And these people have obviously never been in an EV, so are talking from a totally ignorant stand point. Anyone who has ever been in an EV would never make such blanket statements - they would at least acknowledge that the future is electric, whether we want it or not. Yes, it might not be for them just yet - but as sure as eggs are eggs EVs are here to stay, and ICE, certainly as far as personal transport goes, is heading the way of the steam locomotive.

Back to the Leaf - a few things I love, and a few things I don't like.

I love the fact that I've never had to deice this car - not once! It's set to pre-condition itself every morning, so you step into a perfectly warm car (or cool in the summer), with the heated seats and steering wheel up to temperature too.

I love the fact that I've never had to visit a petrol station.

I love the fact that my destination has been sent from my phone to the SatNav, so that's already to go too.

I don't like the vague steering (though it's much better since we switched over to Goodyear All Seasons rather than the ECO tyres it comes with).

I hate the 'Pro-Pilot' autosteer - which has tried to kill me a couple of times.

Someone asked about heating hitting range - yes it does, but not as much as you might think. The V2 Tekna (not sure about other models) has a heat pump for heating, so is very efficient, and also has LED headlamps etc. So it's not so much the heating on these newer Leafs that hits the range, but just the battery temperature - colder batteries charge/discharge less efficiently, and this has the greatest bearing on range. 

And that's about it - its a very average car, that just happens to be electric - and it's the electric side of things that makes it. Is it perfect? Far from it - I wouldn't bother trying to do a long journey in it - though plenty of owners do - but when I have access to other (non EV) cars, for super long trips we take one of those - as I said earlier, rapid charging is a similar cost to running on diesel, so why would I take an average car on a long trip, when I can drive in comfort/style? It's not so much the 'hassle' of charging vs filling up with petrol/diesel - just the comfort/fun I'd rather have on a longer run. For anything less than 150 miles though, it's the Leaf every time, as it's just so cheap to run!

Oh, and for avoidance of doubt, I'm not an EV evangelist, I simply state what I know, EV's are the future, whether we like, or want to admit it, or not. We run two other cars, an XC90 oil burner, and a Nissan 370Z - both at other extremes from the Leaf, and we use them for very different tasks. But as a day-to-day runabout, the Leaf is actually difficult to beat.",@phil_nicholls,17,2023-04-10T15:58:56Z

"I have exactly one of these (71 plate e+ Tekna). Tried all the cheaper EVs, wasn't expecting to like it but better ride, spec, space, range and performance than all of them. Cheaper too (was £28k new after discounts, grant, etc).  It's not exciting but just super easy to live with, it's become the car we use 95% of the time as we can get enough luggage in for family trips and propilot makes motorway driving very relaxed. Enough range that for the vast majority of journeys you just don't need to care about eco driving, or being miserly with the heating. 

e+ can charge a bit quicker (70kW-ish) at many rapids than the smaller battery ones. Did 310 miles yesterday and just did 3 very brief stops when I felt like a comfort break or to grab a sandwich, put it on charge for 10-15 mins each time. No broken chargers, no waiting, all very easy. Still got home with 10% left.",@kiteless1,30,2023-04-10T15:58:17Z

The E-pedal can be set to be permanently on, via the settings, but I find it a pain whilst doing slow speed manoeuvres so leave it off. You were almost correct about the switches, they were relocated from the Mk1. The Mk2 is the same bodyshell with different front and rear tail panels, so I can never understand how it feels so much bigger. The wheelbase is the same as Nissan's Qashqai, so the box in the middle gives you the same space as what would seem to be a larger vehicle. And why buy one? Because the prices have crashed, Nissan dropped the RRP on new Leafs which had a knock-on effect on used prices, on top of high electricity prices people aren't buying at the moment, this could change.

"The older Leafs (Leaves?) in particular can make good buys if you get one cheap enough. Because of their simplicity (in EV terms) they are an easy and inexpensive EV on which to have a battery pack refurbishment carried out. One particular Leaf owner took his 10 year old example to a well known independent EV specialist in Gloucestershire for a battery pack refurb, and the work took 4 hours, and cost £500. A cheap Mk 1 Leaf could readily provide less than 3p per mile motoring on an off-peak EV tariff. Ok, not everyone goes for the Miss Marple body styling, but it sure saves a packet over buying petrol or using public transport. Plus there are now a number of aftermarket mods for the Mk 1 Leaf.....  I don't own a Leaf personally, but I use Octopus Intelligent to charge my EV, and that gives me 6 hours per night at 10p per kwh. A full charge after a week of driving normally costs me around £7. The per mile cost is around 3 to 3.5p, which works out at about a 7th of the cost of buying petrol..... Public charging costs a lot more, but even then, the cost can be reduced by subscribing to the charge network you want to use. And if you have a Sainsburys near you, they still offer free charging.....",@Brian-om2hh,3,2023-04-10T15:30:34Z
"I have a leaf and the one you are driving is a gen 5 and not a gen 2. The first 3 gens all used the same body style while the later 2 used the newer body style. 
I have a gen 3, 30kwh battery and it's an excellent car. I am a regular up and down the motorway and have done 20k miles in it in the last 2 years. 
It is old tech, and second hand prices reflect that. But all of the rapids I go to have the correct connector and more are going in daily. The situation today is miles different/better to that from when I bought the car two years ago. 
Having a plug at home really helps and you are absolutely wrong in saying that 100 miles is not good enough. How often do you actually drive that far before getting home? I suspect far less than you think. 
I agree that gen 1 (2011) cars have problem batteries, something that nissan should have dealt with with a battery upgrade program. But there is a 3rd party network who do upgrades, but virtually the majority of cars never need it.

I did have to google where the handbrake was, I assumed it had an electronic handbrake and would turn off when I started driving, but it didn't, it had a Mercedes style foot operated handbrake, that took me about a good few minutes to work out why I wasn't going anywhere, before I resorted to Google. 

The thing I remember most about my Leaf experience, was every time I put my foot down the volume knob flew off the radio, very high quality fit and finish, in all honesty it seemed to be mostly built ok, but that volume knob I did find amusing.",@Mhlikescars,11,2023-04-10T15:14:27Z
Still too many pitfalls when buying a leaf or any EV it seems until the batteries are cheaper to replace that getting a secondhand EV is really a time game as the batteries charge less and less. The 32 hours charging time is scary along with the possibility of not being able to charge when you get to the charging point as these are not standardised. Buying secondhand would give any buyer a dilemma as when you go to trade in or resell what would you expect to get vs the petrol equivalent so my thoughts would be that the equivalent to a Leaf new would be less than 40k in petrol form and then after six years when all warranty etc are gone for the petrol or EV I can see the petrol being of higher value….,@SuperMauricem,4,2023-04-10T15:13:50Z

No fast charging means it still has most of its range after 7 or 8 years. They did go on some long journeys in it with planned charge stops which works out ok.

"You can also use this car as a V2H, so if you got a big drive and a solar system or Eco elec tarrif you can charge the car over night for cheap and then dump the power back into the house during the day.

After getting used to the e-pedal it's actually really good (obviously slightly biased for me to say that) but believe it's 1 of few EVs that will bring the car to a complete stop without touching the brake pedal, including on decent inclines.

I recently did a wee drive over to Ayrshire on the weekend there and one of the charging hubs (Kilmarnock Arena) it had 4 free rapid chargers, 1 of them the CCS wasn't working but Chademo was working on the unit so was pretty much only for Leafs. So slight bonus the Chademos chargers themselves used less should mean less ware and tear on them (but I think going forwards sites will only add CCS and Leafs obviously can't use Telsa superchargers like other non tesla EVs)",@caolkyle,1,2023-04-10T15:07:28Z

When out of warranty the battery replacement doesn't make fiscal sense as you can pick up a used one for less than it would cost to replace the battery pack.

"Once you go electric there's no going back. I was sold on my first test drive of an electric (the old Leaf) and ended up getting an eGolf three years ago. I'm about to replace it and will probably go for the Leaf. The torque and the smoothness are better even than the best Mercedes, Jaguar or Bentley, and the quietness (it's not quite silent, especially under hard acceleration, when there's a sci-fi whistling sound from the motor) is a delight. No more stupid loud engine noises. No vibration from a clunky dinosaur petrol engine. It's flipping great. 

The only negatives - charging time; can't just stop in a station, fill up and be off after five minutes. I always charge at home using the solar panels on the roof of  my house, but occasionally have to charge when I'm out and about. This means charging has to be planned ahead of time. 

This brings me to point 2 - occupied charging points. Right now charging points are limited and the adoption of electric vehicles has outpaced the number of chargers. A mass installation of public chargers needs to be implemented. It's annoying enough to find all the chargers occupied by other electric vehicles, but when some dick in an ICE car parks in one, out of spite, well, karma, baby. Key karma. Tyre karma. Etc.

Point 3 - range. That's why I leased a car with 85 miles or range.  I'm expecting 500 mile range in five years' time and probably a 1000 or more range  within a decade. But right now we're around 250 miles. 

So those few things sound like deal breakers. But they're really not. For ninety-five per cent of daily driving you'll never need to concern yourself with range or long charging times. More workplaces are installing chargers (mine has twenty chargers in the car park) and you can plug into a wall socket, but your charging time will take longer.

Electric cars are the future and for all the naysayers (people who've never driven an electric car) I always ask ""what's your solution to the end of oil? What's going to replace it?"" I still haven't received a valid answer.",@IAmSoMuchBetterThanYou,1,2018-02-02T19:19:58Z

I own the old leaf 24kw model and it's brilliant for local driving saves me around a 100 pounds a month in fuel costs. Doing about 200 miles a week inner city stop start driving. The car pays for itself as in the repayments work out roughly what it saves in fuel costs. Give it 3 years and I will probably part exchange it for this new model having a greater range will make it more usable. But realistically how often do you drive 200 miles a day unless you are a taxi driver or something. Second hand electric cars are incredible value for money.

By the way, let's get just a wee more accurate about the 2018 Leaf's range - the standard battery will likely provide about 150 miles. Don't get confused by the Japanese standard of measurement, which is akin to the European one. The American EPA rating is closer to the truth.  Aside from these things, the Leaf still looks like a Leaf, though I can say I now regard the new styling as reasonably attractive instead of relatively butt ugly. Still no comparison to the GORGEOUS Model III.  The Leaf, however, will be a good deal more affordable for many to buy, compared to all but the most basic Model III configuration.  I think the Leaf now has a good deal more to recommend it, and aside from all this, let's keep in mind that Tesla is and will not be ""threatened"" by any other EVs; They are light years ahead of the curve.

Euro range and millage estimates are always less realistic than US ones... for example the new leaf looks like in the UK you can only get the 40kw battery and they rate it at 168 miles of city driving... for the US 40kw it says 123 miles of city driving.,@xupthree60,0,2024-05-01T15:44:36Z

"the issue is that the trip computer predicts the distance based obviously on available battery capacity but also on speed and how aggressive you press the throttle, it wouldn't be uncommon for the trip computer to be 20 miles off or more. I drove this car for 3 years, , it was a 2015, they updated it in 2013 with heat pump and some other things like a dedicated Heat on/off button which was very convenient. 

The best way to describe driving an electric car is when you're driving down the motorway in most electric cars, it's as if you're driving a petrol or diesel with a hole in the tank, smaller battery cars feels like the hole is bigger, if that makes sense ?

Electric cars are good 2nd hand buys for 2nd family cars if only doing short trips then again if you're only doing short trips you can get a cheaper petrol that will travel anywhere any time without the hassle of public charging because it is a right pain in the arse after the novelty wears off and it wears off quickly. 

I would say even the latest electric cars are good for 2nd family cars with an ICE car at home but why would you pay so much ? it makes no economic sense and you will be shocked at trade in. 

I'm in the position now where my 2.5 year old Volkswagen Id.3 77 kwh is worthless because no one wants to take the car as trade in unless I give it away , it was 41 K Euro's new ( Ireland prices ) and I was offered between 11k and 15K Euro's max.

So what this tells me also is that high spec and having a larger battery makes no difference, so if you want to buy an electric car and pay a lot more for the larger battery option be warned that this adds no value to the trade in price so my advice is buy the cheapest EV you can get if you want one, in other words, if there's 2 battery options, one 55 Kwh and the other 77 Kwh but the 55 Kwh because the 77 Kwh adds no value when you trade it in but then you're left with even less range, but my advice is save the money and don't buy electric car to begin with as you are not going to save money or the Earth !

I will have to wait until the PCP is up and hope some dealer will just take it back and I can buy a real car again after 9 years and 3rd EV later finally realising it's a huge financial mistake buying an electric car, although the real issue is that they don't want electric cars because they can't sell them. So I might have to set fire to it and claim the insurance as right now there literally is no way to get rid of it. ( joke ) at the end of the PCP I will be over 20,000 kms over the limit times whatever the extra mileage charge is so at that rate I'll have to pay to hand it back but another lesson to be learned, don't buy new cars, especially Electric and do not go with PCP finance, it's a bottomless pit !",@o00scorpion00o,0,2024-05-01T08:46:44Z

"'Not much that can go wrong with an electric motor' mmm lol !. Guess you never heard of bearings or gear drive trains (yes EVs still have drive train reduction gears and diffs lol) and what about the liquid cooled 3 phase electronic motor control systems/speed control systems/coolant pumps and plumbing for motor/battery cooling and inverters?, or anything else related to its control systems then of which any component going pop means game over for an older EV, especially with anything electrical with 10 years on it!. Most pcb smd caps for example used on motor drive pcb's have a rated life of only 2 to 2.5k hours and @ 1 hour use a day = 8 years mtbf - a very convenient 80 to100k miles for an EV, so all timed to fail around the same time (battery/electrical control systems)... The thing is I really like the idea of electric, they just have to be made with better components such as solid state caps instead of cheap electrolytic ones with 5k+ mtbf, but I doubt they will, EV's are designed to fail, its built in to their components (as for batteries, 10 years is close to end of life for any device really with current technology, so an automatic scrappage timebomb for any EV regardless of usage)... Petrol/diesel vehicle design in the electrical department are no different, except they are easy to re-cap by just removing the easy to access ecu and replacing the capacitors on them (done it myself many times), EV ones are buried in with the motor assembly/liquid cooled and usually require drive system/motor strip downs to get to them so most wont even touch them and those that do charge $$$ in labour alone usually instantly scrapping the vehicle.",@Ra-zor,1,2024-04-28T17:35:05Z

Now I drive a Volkswagen ID.3 77 Kwh EV and it has a claimed 340 Miles but in reality 217 Miles at decent speeds , so whatever the manufacturer says reduce this by around 35-40%.

I'm driving EV 9 years and won't be buying another, depreciation is an absolute killer, been told by around 5 dealers that they don't want to trade an EV, VW themselves offering me half what I paid after 2.5 years. 

All this in car tech and entertainment is highly distracting and I don't like using the touchscreen to do simple things like change Climate settings or radio, or suffering sluggish software, waiting for it to boot up before you can even access climate settings for example is highly irritating, I hate these systems and it's the worst thing ever to infect the auto industry, big screen for entertainment and even now you will find it hard to find analogue instrument cluster they have mostly changed to hideous looking screens.

"As a 2-time used EV owner, a 2013 Nissan Leaf is literally the worst case scenario. There are some small-battery cars that do actually surprise you. The Kia Soul EV is an example of that, simply because they actually decided to regulate the battery's temperature with water to extend it's lifespan. Leafs just let the batteries boil in the summer and freeze in the winter. I owned a 2018 Kia Soul EV with an EPA estimated 111 miles of range for almost two years, and the furthest I travelled on a single charge was 118 miles, and the range dropped onto to around 90 miles in the winter. It was genuinely a great car, and even charged at 70 kW from time to time! That charging speed let me recharge in 20-25 minutes, which some other expensive cars are still struggling to reach.
Now I drive a 2017 Chevy Bolt so I can finally reasonably go on road trips, absolutely love it! Although, I miss some features of the Kia Soul. I rarely hit 50 kW when fast charging, usually more around 37 kW. Can take FOREVER to charge. However, the refreshed 2024 Bolt should address this by moving it to the Ultium platform.

Perfectly possible to install a new battery however the design of the cars and the cost of the batteries makes it prohibitive.

The ""guessometer"" is exactly what it sounds like -- the range is changing because your driving style or conditions are not optimal, so it's adjusting its best guess from that. If you knew this, you wouldn't be surprised or freaking out about the miles figure change. Go downhill and it'll go back up again just as rapidly. It's not the same as a petrol gauge. Electric range varies based on conditions: grade, driving style, temperature, AC usage etc. etc.

Also, failing to point out early in the video that these old cars with no battery conditioning and old battery chemistry suffer enormously from degradation that modern cars don't is a huge emission. Hope you mention that later in the video.

I bought a 2011 Nissan Leaf for a similarly impressive price as a commuter car a few years ago, and with all the nice premium features it had, it still remains the best per-dollar car I've ever bought.

He took a broken something from a Microwave TV Truck home from work. And wanted to see if he could fix it? Yes he did. Yes it is fixed. On, WLS, he had no audio. But he fixed that. So when he broke in on top of, WTTR. That's when he had garbage audio. So that didn't fully get fixed. He was not using a Ring Modulator. It wasn't deviating right. He was. And knew it sounded like a Ring Modulator. That's why it was broke. And they couldn't use it for TV News Shots, anymore. So he took it home. And pointed the microwave dish. At the transmitter sites, microwave dish. And swamped it. Expertly! He worked in the industry. He probably worked for a Rival Station. He was never caught. He knew what he was doing. He's just like me! I was never caught either. But I did a radio broadcast. When I was 14 years old. And stuck my signal on the International Shortwave Bands. Right between, Radio Havana Cuba and Radio Moscow. And I did a rock 'n' roll show. For a little over an hour. When I realized. My signal was getting out all, too well. When I got a couple of miles away from home on my bicycle. And the signal strength meter. On my shortwave receiver I had with me on my bicycle. Was still showing a solid, 10. Whoopsy! I got home and shut off my, 3 hour-long taped show. I was listening to of myself. While out riding my bicycle. With a shortwave receiver. Back in 1969. I wanted to see if I could Broadcast to the Astronauts on the Moon? And quite possibly so? As I'm sure the FCC in downtown Detroit. Had me 5 x 5. And I better get home and shut it down. Before they find out where I am! Yikes!

I knew nothing much would happen if I had been caught. But could have affected. My actual Broadcasting Career. Which I was planning to follow through with. And wouldn't want to try to get in the business. Some kind of dark stain from the get go. So I didn't do that again. Even though I wanted to LOL. It was so cool! I'm on the air! And listening to my show. While riding my bicycle. What a rush. And I knew I wanted to do that on the FM Radio. Because it sounded much better than, AM radio. As it is hi-fi Diddle Dee. In 2 Ear Stereo! As we only have 2. That's all you need. You don't need 4-6-10-14 Speakers! That's just more advertising and marketing bullshit. When you don't have your speakers connected correctly of the 2. Everybody thinks they have them connected correctly. They follow the instructions. They follow the manual. Yeah but it's wrong. It's indicated wrong.

This is something I discovered back in 1978. When I designed and Built. My first, Large, brick-and-mortar, Recording Studio. All 5000 ft.² of it. And found this Pro Audio, faux pas, Anomaly. And I've been turning everybody onto this ever since. You just, reverse the connections. On both your left and right channel speakers.  That's all you need, to do. And you will hear an astounding difference. A game changing, difference. You will now be completely delighted. With your cheap crap stereo. It has never sounded like this before! You'll hear. It's a very funny little thing. That every single, cotton pickin', electrical engineer and acoustic engineer. Reliably gets wrong. Reliably gets backwards. They get it, backwards. Because they get the math right. But math is not Sound. You have to know what you're listening to. They don't. Because textbook formulas and mathematical equations. Don't make any sound of their own. And their test equipment. Can neither listen to nor evaluate. Anything it is perceiving. Anything it is notating and recording. It's stupid. It's inanimate. It's not alive. It's not breathing. It has no life. No brain. No ears. It is inanimate. We are not.

So give this a try for yourselves. But if you have active powered speakers. You're going to have to be good with a Phillips screwdriver and soldering iron. You will need to remove. Both the woofers and the tweeters. From the speaker box.  And using your soldering iron. You will reverse the connections on both the tweeters and the woofers. Then reinstall the speakers. And do not demonstrate your incredible strength. Screwing them back in.  Do not over torque. You can warp the speaker frame. Go gentle. Make it snug. Don't make a death grip, tightening. And you can thank me later once you hear the difference. It's an astounding, difference. You will start to giggle like a little kid. You won't believe your ears. And how could all those college grads be that stupid? Simple. They don't know what the speakers are supposed to sound like? They only know, textbook formulas and mathematical equations. They don't sound. They don't audio. Some of us do. Because we wanted to. And I personally wanted to be the Best Engineer in the World. And I am. And now retired. And I'm sharing my knowledge with everyone.

It's a simple funny little thing. Everyone has gotten wrong for over 60 years. Maybe longer?

"No not really. ALL EV's are rip offs. What can go wrong with a battery pack?

Im a car person and EV's scare trf out of me because you can't just look at it and tell if its going bad. Thats why it doesn't ""feel"" like anything can go wrong because its all hidden. Love how it says ""keepers"" implying you don't even own the car, you are just keeping it for the time being and got had pay them for the luxury lol That only works for the leaf, if you have literally anything else you can't see state of charge so easily.

"Few things as an ex-Leaf owner (2015 version):
• I think the 124 range you mentioned, was the ""rated"" range, which is about as reliable as the range-o-meter in the dash. I had the Tekna (top spec at the time) and I used to get about 90 miles safely with normal driving style.
• The range-o-meter was affectionately known as the ""guess-o-meter"" in the community. It bases the range of current driving so the estimate changes wildly as you drive.
• I opted for the Tekna model as it had a heat pump for the climate, other models had a resistive heating system that would eat battery!
• The map in the car used to make me chuckle, especially as I used to potter over to the Trafford Centre a lot and it had the ""Manchester Ship Canal"" listed as ""Manchester Shit Canal"" which was classic as there is a sewage works next to the motorway as you went over it.
• It uses a CHAdeMO rapid charging connector which in the UK is getting harder and harder to find. CCS2 is the standard now and CHAdeMO has been phased out a lot over the past years.

Honestly, when I had the car I loved it. I made some videos on it including charging at rapid stations. When my finance finished I switched to an ICE Ford Fiesta after it and really missed it, but at the time the then ""new"" Leaf was ridiculously expensive. These days I am in a Model 3 and soon a Model Y as well and it is night and day. Driving down to London I look at the services I use to have to stop at in the Leaf and remember the stop start nature, now the range of the Tesla is longer than I would drive without a break. It was a great car, I used to love the acceleration especially at traffic lights with a Police car next to me, setting the speed limiter to 33MPH and flooring it, I did about 30k miles in it with no charger at home (lived in an apartment block at the time) and I still look back on the car as a great car.

I think the mold is probably from the car ignoring its personal hygiene.  Ignoring hygiene is a pretty common outwardly visible symptom of depression.  I think the car is probably suffering some serious depression and low self esteem secondary to the fact that it is a Nissan.  So on top of the short range and the purchase price  and possible lease of a battery you may need to purchase car therapy and anti-depressant medication. Plus once you are driving a Nissan Leaf chances are you may need anti depression meds.

"Some extremely useful info regarding batteries: 

There are 3 main different battery technologies that were at some point or another used in EVs. 
Li-Ion, Li-Po, LiFePo4. 
The market right now is almost if not completely exclusively using Li-Ion batteries due to their small size and light weight. 
Basically Li-Po are the lightest and smallest, but also have the worst charge cycle count (how many times you can charge the battery 0-100% before it is considered ""bad""). 
LiFePo4 have by far the superior charge cycle count, but are quite bigger and heavier. 

So the happy middle ground is Li-Ion. Many times used in this 18650 or 21700 cell form factor. 

That Nissan Leaf, might have been using Li-Po batteries just by seeing those pouches and how they got swollen. Generally you can expect up to 100-300 cycles out of a Li-Po, 300-1000 out of a Li-Ion and 1500-6000 out of a LiFePo4 battery. 

What is a charge cycle really? 
In theory it is the sum of the partial charge cycles (for example 40-100, 15-100, 50-100, 95-100, these four charges would be 2 full charge cycles, because they sum at 200% of charge need). But that's not the whole story. A battery is happier if it's SoC (state of charge) doesn't fall below 20%. Most importantly it's way happier if it doesn't stay below 20% for extended periods of time (not charging it for a day or two...). It's also happy if it doesn't stay at 100% for extended periods of time. So, if you make sure that the battery isn't close to those extremes, you can extend these charge cycles quite considerably. 
So, for example a Tesla battery of the last year, should have some Li-Ion cells capable of 1000 charge cycles (impressively high for Li-Ion, best on the market). If tesla engineers make sure their reported SoC is slightly different to the real SoC of the battery, making sure to stay away from those extremes, the battery can last up to 3500 smaller charge cycles (25-90%), which is up to 2500 full charge cycles instead of just 1000... 

3500 charge cycles is roughly 10 years somebody might say. And that's pretty much the case if someone totally drains their car daily. However,I don't believe tesla puts so relaxed extremes to their batteries (because they would lose advertised range that way...), so I think it's more like 2000 cycles of 10-90%. 
Roughly 6 years for daily draining. 
Realistically you will use all the battery every 2-3 days if you drive a lot, so... 12-16 years? Something like that. 

Is charge cycle count the only consideration when talking about battery life? 
No... 

Battery ageing occurs no matter what, it's just faster if the battery is empty or full. 

For a Li-Ion battery you can expect 10-15 years of battery life no matter how much you take care of it. 

So. What does it mean for a battery to die? 

In the world of Lithium batteries, a dead battery is a battery that is below 80% if its original capacity. Why is that? 
Basically from 100% to 80% the battery again curve is a straight line, slowly going down in a straight line as the years or the charge cycles pass. 
However at 80% of its original capacity, this straight line becomes a more and more aggressive curve. 

That actually means that after that 80% point, the ageing of the cells occurs faster and faster and faster. You might need 10 years to go to 80%, but you will need 5 years to go to 60%. 2 years to go to 40%. 1 year to go to 10%. 
That's just an example, but these numbers are almost accurate. 

So basically, your battery is still ok at 85%. At 80% starts the downhill and nothing can stop it. 

So, what does that mean for the Nissan Leaf? First of all, the car already has a kind of bad battery technology if they were using Li-Po cells. So, I assume the 100-80% window closed at around 8 years of use at best. Secondly, the battery that now is at 65-70% is considered dead. You can expect month by month to see a slight reduction in mileage. In the next ~2-4 years, the battery will completely die, unable to do much of anything. 
Are 1500£ worth it? Meh... Idk... The car works and it's electric... It might not pay itself because there are too few charge cycles remaining...  I mean, for 1500£, you get an electric scooter with less range, so... Yeah. It is kind of value for money... I might would have bought this or something similiral and try to fit my own batteries somehow 😃 
That would give me 15 full years of way better range... They only bad thing is that these things have lots of factory locks and stuff... I'd really love to be able to put my own batteries on any of the EVs... Imagine having a second full battery in the trunk... Imagine doing that on a new car. 1000km of range. 

Anyways. These were some nice info for Lithium batteries.",@FishFish1995,4,2024-04-17T14:10:58Z

"I’d pay $1500 for a leaf with 60 miles of range IF it wasn’t for Indiana charging $400 a year for a license plate for ANY EV.

I was going to buy a Fiat 500E back when you could get a 3-4yr old one with under 30k miles on it for around $5000.  You’d have to pay to import it from Georgia but to Chicagoland transport is very cheap.  Less than $1000 I usually pay $400-600 to import cars from Florida (rust free).  

Anyways I wanted it for my wife to drive 2 miles a day for work and to do grocery runs.  But then that year Indiana stabbed me in the face when I went to go renew the plates on my $14k 2.5yr old 20k mile BMW i3 REx plug-in serial hybrid (because it’s considered an EV).  My parallel plug-in hybrids have been more expensive per year than ICE registration but not $400+.

Anyways I did the math and my wife could get 15mph driving to work and pay only $100 for fuel a year to get to work.  Sure it would tear the engine up which is why I wanted an EV so we compromised and we now own an ‘12 Civic EXL normal ICE car for long distance and backup vehicle driving.  A ‘17 CMax Energi Plug-In for my wife which gets 15-20 miles of EV range and we own a ‘21 Bolt which my wife loves but I regret buying especially when I found out I could have bought a ‘17 Civic Type-R for the same price and that’s just as much a family car :).  

States are stabbing us in the backs for buying EVs and hybrids because they are loosing money on gas taxes.  Only thing is they aren’t charging us fairly.  You’d have to buy a few thousand in gas to pay $300 in taxes on gasoline.  Plus it’s semi trucks that ruin the roads not light weight EVs.",@williammurphy6104,0,2024-04-17T08:28:48Z

"The biggest thing about a car like this, is what if I want to hop on the highway and go to a park 35 miles away? Even brand new the old Leaf might not make it home. This used example definitely not.

EVs in general are just problematic in their economics, yes if you have a few mile daily jaunt, sure you are fine. And if you are getting a brand new one which much better range than the old leaf, you are fine with a 100 mile daily commute. But the moment you want to go for a road trip you have to rent or own an ICE car to do that. Or plan out charging stops which are gonna take forever.

I think the best use case for EVs are small motorcycles, scooters, and E bikes where they can be manufactured much more cheaply and use a much smaller battery. That way the economics of replacing the battery isn't a big deall. Just a few hundred bucks every 5 years or so to put a fresh battery in it. Something like a Honda Grom but electric and with 60 miles of range would be genuinely pretty awesome, for the right price and user serviceability...

Gone back to petrol for now, but I'd be happy to go back to full EV sometime in the future. In 3 years of owning mine, I never ran out of charge... although I was bloody close a few times! Once I even managed to get it into ""turtle mode"". But the car's sat nav is fantastic and will give you routes via charging stations if it needs it. Using sat nav doesn't use any additional battery as the radio/sat nav is essentially always on. The car's heater though drains the battery for fun!

"I said several years ago that EV batteries would have massive drops in range as batteries degraded,  its just what happens to all batteries under recharge cycles, and people scoffed at me for saying it. I worry now it will actually be even worse than I thought, 

When these EV's start hitting 15-20 years old will we see enourmous drops in range?  will this leaf will hit a point when it's top range is sub 20 miles fully charged? That's madness.

Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of 2008 combustions car are still be going strong... A combustion engine gradually fails, many parts can be fixed fairly cheaply, and total engine failure is rare, far more are scrapped for Rust, or run until they simple cant pass an MOT any more. 

But ALL EV's suffer battery degradation, it's how batteries work,  they all evcentually will hit sub 50 mile ranges... in fact they will all eventually see sub 10 when fully charged, Batteries degrade pure and simple, its not a part suddenly fails, its literally a linear range decrease for every battery. 

It's likely an average 15 years usable lifespan, and that's not being pessimistic, solar batteries too are sold as having a useable 15 year lifespans. It's how batteries work.

At some point ALL EV's will be too expensive to repair...  every EV car! 10 year cars are already worth less than the replacement battery packs cost! SO the Inevitability is battery death and the scrapyard!

The expert here is describing using battery packs from newer crashed EV to keep decade old EV's running... to as he said 'stop them being worthless or obsolete' that says a lot to me, not 20 year old cars, 10 year old ones! And the fix is more than the cars value...

Based on fuel/leccy costs back in 2012, and with a projected annual mileage of 12k, it would have taken 13 years for a Leaf to become more economical than a Note.

Only trouble is, of course, that it seems a Leaf would never have made it to 140K miles on the original battery and I would have had to replace the battery after about 5 years (at which point the Leaf would have been £8k less economical than the Note).

"EV's are rip-off and scam period. Its city store runner, but hazard for any building its parked next to and you will loose massive amounts of money, even with money stolen from populous and government giving that then out to buy this rubbish. Just from appreciation dropping and when any component from the drivetrain dies and it will, regardless its sitting in warm garage and pampered with best possible care, battery will degrade and that alone is more than the vehicle is worth, so buying new EV is financially stupid idea even with the grants, but its even worse if you buy it after manufacturers warranty is over. In future ones that will suffer the most are low income families that are forced to buy EV due artificially increased costs of owning ICE thanks to taxation and then get financially ruined when the battery or any other component dies, as they cant afford to replace it. Just look how much just drive motor costs. Its several times more than buying used ICE cars that cost pennies in comparison to use and maintain.

Further more, in new vehicles, specially EV's there is wireless automated updates that can just by tabbing accept with out reading the whole agreement, can limit the time and range you are allowed to drive with it, essentially boxing you into those failed 15minute cities by force, this being the new way they are attempting this attack on basic human rights. If it has wifi and wireless updates, well as any automation like drive by wire, dont buy that shit, cause you wont be owning it anymore.

"People moaning about lack of range & range anxiety are idiots. All you need to do is calculate this simple formula before every journey:
Distance needed (A) x kinetic alignment to the power of -0.8 {6667.9} deduct 6% of the ambient temperature (allowing for fluctuation in battery temperature every 17 seconds.) Now calculate the gravitational load plus the tyre friction (will vary depending of weather conditions) & multiply the by 100% voltage (sinc) + air density to the power of 9. Then simply take this figure & divide by the distance you need to travel and that is your exact range but remember to re-check every 100 yards as there may be a fluctuation that compromises your figure.
Quite why you are all complaining about anxiety range is perplexing. You just don't know what you're doing, that's the problem.",@asensibleyoungman2978,1,2024-04-15T13:19:40Z
"You had to know that starting off out of Economy mode you were never going to get the maximum city range of 120 miles in stop and go traffic and be automatically dropped to 100 or fewer miles of range even when the car was new.  If your stopped with your foot on the brake and not in park you are going to waste battery which is a given too.  One has to wonder if this was intentionally done for dramatic effect?

The expectation as it has been since new is that at around 18 miles remaining range indicated your going to get a low battery warning with the recommendation to stop and charge the battery then as you hit the last few available miles the expectation is to go into turtle mode restricting you to around 20ish mph until it shuts down.

If you are seeing less than 5 mile per kWh indicated on the dash (you might have to scroll through the options to display this) then the car has not be driven by a reasonable person and perhaps by someone who drove it like they stole it so the range estimate will be based on that history of poor driving.  Tire pressure and tires are also a critical item on a city car like the Leaf so if the original LLR tires were replaced with non-LLR tires and the tire pressures have gone low giving a more cushy ride then even when new range will drop quickly and you'll never get the max range from the vehicle.

Of course loading Leaf Spy Pro on your phone and connecting it to your Leaf with a Bluetooth OBDII dongle will tell you much of what the battery testing site will at a much lower cost and also allow you to log how its reacting during your trip.

Still for a city car designed for the less than 30 miles daily round trip driving of Joe and Jane Average the roughly 70 miles you get in Economy Mode from a 10 year old Leaf isn't a bad deal.  Driven reasonably they will get your through 2 days of driving and still charge completely overnight while your sleeping using the free courtesy charger that came with the car which requires no special wiring be done to plug it in.

That said I have a 10 year old Leaf and still do take 60 mile drives on some days.  Over the past 10 years I've only stopped once at a public charger and am still using the free L1 courtesy charger that came with the car and have not needed to install an L2.

"If used EV's get to this price point they sure are useful for city runs and so on, but with the rate the technology improves and with the rate batteries deteriorates and with the rate electric cars depreciate, who's gonna want to buy a new one? 
An electric car loses 50% of its value in about 2 years, a petrol or diesel powered car loses about 30% of its value in the same time, and the latter is a lot cheaper to start with so you end up with a car that has a deteriorated battery and range and it is now worth about the same as a new diesel or petrol powered equivalent. I understand why the full electric industry is crumbling. 

I approve the electric car 100% but there needs to be a MASSIVE improvement in efficiency! Going from being able to drive 1000kms and then spending 5 minutes to do another 1000kms to only be able to do 400 (at best) and then having to spend 5 hours to do the same again is not one step back, it's a giant leap back. So until the fueling issue is addressed properly, i.e. either a hydrogen solution which can be implemented in all pre-existing service stations for a faster fill up and a longer range or a battery pack which can easily be charged in minutes, I don't think the electric industry will recover. 

And also if governments allowed renewable fossil fuels for older cars we wouldn't have to spend millions and cause tons and tons of CO2 pollution by scrapping old cars that could go on for years.",@Philip.Magnusson,0,2024-04-15T10:19:00Z

So the only difference in affordability is the need to finance, not the amount we spend per month to own it. 

I've never borrowed money to buy a car on finance, and I imagine many others haven't either, because the depreciation is jus lost money. So if you couldn't afford to buy it cash, perhaps you shouldn't buy it at all. BUT, the argument changes with EVs because they can save money every month in running costs (particularly when charged at home on a discount overnight tariff, but also in servicing and maintenance). And thus, cost you the same as some old banger to own over 5 years. 

So the question is, if you're going to spend the money to run the car anyway (which you are already), would you rather have an older ICE car that might still require random maintenance and unseen costs, servicing, Road tax, and fuel costs - OR would you prefer a newer modern car, with some luxuries, lower running costs and maintenance needs (than even a newer ICE car would), and still spending the same amount each month. 

I've always had old cars that i could buy outright. But with a used Tesla model 3 at £14-15000, or a Model S at even £13k, or a Hyundai Kona Electric (280 mile range) at £10-11K, etc......if I just sold my diesel car, and put that money down as a deposit on finance and then paid £200 a month. I could effectively have what feels like a brand new car with no additional coast to what I pay now. 

That's pretty hard to resist.  

Better yet, if all I did was drive to work and back in it, less than 30 miles a day. I could buy an old leaf, and then have our 2nd family car as the diesel long journey one. 
30 miles, 5 days a week for 44 weeks of the year is 7200 miles. Which would give a saving of £1400 in fuel, not to mention the £400 a year road tax I currently pay, £150 service each year, and numerous little things that have gone wrong....that's £2000 a year saved.

So as a second car just for a work commute it would pay for itself in 12 months.....doesn't sound stupid to me.

Last month I took it on a 2,000 mile road trip from North Carolina to Florida and in a couple of months I'm taking it on a 5,000 mile road trip to Arizona.

"Hmmm... 2013 Leaf 25k new. Now does 60 miles in one session max and will cost £8k to improve the mileage. Its done 44k miles and is worth £1500 as it is next to useless. 
On the other hand you could have purchased a 2013 Focus ST for £22k - had a much nice car - driven 100k miles and sold for £6.5k - it will still drive as nearly far as when new and be nearly as fast, maybe it will do another 100k miles.

£3k saving on initial purchase - £5k extra value upon sale of vehicle = £8k in your pocket which is enough to do 44,000 miles during that time period. Leaf milage covered.
 
With the Leaf due yet to cover its manufacturing carbon footprint as it is already due to be scrapped assuming its using coal-generated electricity: we can calculate the total CO2 emissions from charging the Nissan Leaf 

34.6 kgCO2/charge * 642 charges = 22,207.2 kgCO2 = 22.2 metric tons of CO2 

The 2013 Ford Focus ST emits about 183g of CO2 per km123. If it has covered 44,000 miles, it would have emitted about 13 metric tons of CO2 from driving. however it is proven to live on much longer, with the miles being covered by the initial saving and residual value.

"Ev battery’s have definitely gotten better by looking at this video, we have the Maxus delivery 9 ev’s in our fleet at work and some of them have already done the amount this Nissan has done and there’s no sign of battery degradation as of yet. The manufacturer specified they do 220 miles, but even when new they shown 178 miles with a full battery, and to be fair it is accurate, even when fully loaded weighing 4.2T. The reliability isn’t too bad, we have had a few that had problems where they wouldn’t accept a fast charge and had to be looked at but other than that they’re good.

I think the biggest issue with EVs are the fact the public fast chargers are ridiculously expensive compared to the fuel alternative, to fully charge the van at a fast charger it costs around £100, so that’s £100 for 178 miles compared to a diesel that would travel 300+ miles with the same amount.

"He says “what could go wrong” & “more reliable than an internal combustion engine car of the same age”
My answer: The battery….

I read the other day, Nissan are planning to phase out that app (I’m guessing to be replaced with one that only functions with new models).

Most cars in modern times suffer with faults other than engine, such as suspension, tho diesel’s do have specific issues (EGR, DPF, dual mass flywheel).

Also do these cars use that Japanese plug type which is being rapidly replaced by CCS because of mandate in UK & EU?
(Aside from the household 3pin adapter-very slow charging).

My bet is, aside from spending £8,000 to upgrade its battery, petrol + diesel cars of the same age are a better bet and if looked after will outlast original style Nissan Leafs (assuming you don’t spend thousands on a new battery).

"Generally, used EVs are a bargain compared to if you buy one brand new; most of them, they depreciate horrendously and so quickly it's hard to really understand why you'd get one brand new outside of just flexing it to others. I know the car's value depreciate, that's just life, but it's so extreme with electric cars.

Last month, I saw a listing for a Mazda MX-30, which was only five months old with 1,008 miles, priced at £15,500, which was under HALF its original price, roughly around £32,000! I can also see another one, not the same spec or mileage (but not that high at 2,400 miles) but similar age for £15,000. And an electric Corsa I see at a year old has lost over half its value already too. 

At these heavily tumbled prices, if they were brand new, which they more or less are, honestly, a lot more of us would be all over these electric cars if they weren't so overpriced to begin with; it doesn't suit me however, due where the car is parked in relation to the house, being on a curved portion of the street with the road seperating them.

"I drive my old diesel chugger around with the 'Miles remaining in tank' feature on most of the time, i.e., exactly the same as range in an EV. Of course the number goes up and down all the time depending on speed/gears/load etc. No one has to drive around AT the speed limit - it is what it says, the top speed anyone should be driving at. Driving at 50 in a 60 limit might infuriate some other drivers who haven't yet understood that, eg, 60 is the very most anyone should be driving at, and speed should always be part of driving to road/weather/other traffic conditions. So, drive at 50 in a 60, maybe 45 in a 50, although 25 in a 30 can be frustrating (funny how many people don't seem able to drive at a steady speed anyway), and the newer 20 limit should really be done at 20, despite the white van driving up yer chuff! My range starts at about 850 with a brimmed tank. So I only see '30 miles remaining in tank' infrequently, then 5 minutes in a fuel station et voila! another 850 miles of stress-free driving.

"So much cope in this video 🤣
Look, if you are someone with a privately owned residence, have access to home charging and do very limited miles then yes I see the point. Limiting someone to 60 miles range, well really 50-55 as nobody will run to literal empty before charging, is still fairly poor. Because that means if you need to travel more than 25 miles away from your home you WILL need to stop and use a public charger. Wintery day it will be slightly less again. I just find that completely unacceptable considering you can get about 33-39mpg from a 1.6 petrol (around that £1500 mark) which is about 366-432 miles to empty on 50l. Even take 30 miles off that, nobody runs til you run out, you are still at worst 336 miles from full. My old 06' 1.9TDI PD Golf got 42-46mpg driving around suburbs (33-35mpg from cold and very short journeys), overall you'll get 450-500 miles to a tank.

I'm not hating on EVs, they suit very low mileage and people who have access to home charging. Whereas the internal combustion engine has a huge range of applications to suit the needs of the driver. Will technology improve? Of course, nobody is denying that improvements are being made. I fully believe in Hydrogen is the way forward for convenience and range, but again it has a long way to go. 

My final issue (not really relevant to this video) is new car prices are simply unattainable for the average working class family. Nearly every car manufacture is ""going upmarket"" and filling cars with ludicrous amounts of tech. Example, 10 years ago a baseline Skoda Fabia 1.2 petrol had an OTR of £9995. Today, a 2024 baseline Fabia stands at £19730, that a 97% increase in the OTR price. When you look at the BoE inflation calculator (very basic and there are discrepancies), the Fabia should be in the region of £13200, a 32% increase with inflation. Dacia to their credit are still offering a baseline Sandro at £13750, which don't get me wrong is still a 63% increase in the OTR price of 2014 at £8395. For the EV market to thrive, you need a bunch family hatchback size models at sub-14/15k prices to hit the market TODAY. Making it more accessible for lower to middle income earners that will eventually sell on at the 3/5 year mark which makes even more people able to access EVs.

How anyone can suggest that a car with a universal water leak and a total range of 60 miles is a viable proposition is beyond me. And the AA has to be on standby every time you expect to travel anywhere near the total mileage!
PS If you drive the car on a cold winter day the 60miles will reduce to 45-50 if you are very lucky.

Newer EV car batteries are better and bigger, but at the 10 years mark will have done more miles and charge cycles than a car that only did 80 ish miles to start with.

I would never buy Nissan again.   The dealer actually lied to me about getting that infotainment center communication card upgraded and that was very frustrating.   In December a couple years ago they told me a new card was coming out and it would be free under warranty for me if I just call back in January.

"What's different between a banger petrol car and a degraded battery EV is that the EV drives exactly as it did when new. Same power, same silent and serene drive, and reliable. All that happens is that the 'fuel tank' gets smaller over time. But with home charging you always wake up with a full tank anyway. And if that range is enough for a normal day's travel - happy days. An older petrol car becomes a money pit of repairs as the engine and its 1000's of moving parts wear out. And unreliable, meaning that often you cant rely on getting to work that day. Old EVs still fit in with many peoples plans. And when the tin bits eventually fail the battery is still a valuable item for people to sellotape to their wall at home and use as home battery storage for their solar roof. Contrary to the FUD merchant rants they are also recyclable when they ultimately fail, and the various expensive elements recovered to be used again.",@Hitstirrer,0,2024-04-12T13:16:14Z

Awesome video. Now can you do another similar one with the Zoe? The difference is that the Leaf is among the very few cars with no battery cooling whatsoever (Zoe has air cooling) which in theory has been an engineering tragedy because it needlessly aggravates battery degradation. So with a similarily old Zoe we should in theory see much better battery condition. Would be very interested in seeing something like that. Cheers.,@Groaznic,7,2024-04-11T10:42:08Z

Newer EVs past 2017 are done on the WLTP/WLTC ratings instead which are better, but still not quite as good as the american EPA ratings.",@Ryanteck42,0,2024-04-11T10:15:54Z

When my 1994 ute is finally scrapped, only the plastic and rubber components will cause landfill pollution, compared to a greater percentage of plastics and the non-recyclable battery full of nasty chemicals that the Leaf sports (currently EV batteries are sitting in a storage waste pile in New Zealand since nobody here has recycling technology).

MUCH more for people in other countries where gas ( petrol ) is more expensive . 
Besides the huge cost to charge, it seems 6 out of 10 chargers will be broken, and the rest will be in use, or blocked by ICE vehicles. 
Also, you will have the added stress of having everyone mad at you for taking so long to charge your car. 
And what are going to do while it charges ? Just sit there and read a book for over an hour in the hot sun ?

If a manufacturer made a car and sold it on the market that would only do 120 miles it would never sell.  If that car still couldn't give 120 miles after being on the road for 10 years no-one would even consider it in the used market.  We have all come to expect our ICE vehicles to have a seriously long range and to sell cars as equivalent that go a far shorter distance and take far longer to refuel is just lunacy.

"It’s very frustrating watching you try to build jeopardy about range without understanding how the car works. You shouldn’t use the guessometer. Turn on the battery percentage remaining display. That’s the true measure of the battery, not the range number. Because the range number is based on last driving style. Only drive this car in ECO from the start and without AC on. It’s a 10 year old car. You claimed it was a 2013 but you clearly have a 2011/2012 model with the old style inverter under the bonnet and charger in the back?

personally electric cars do not interest me, ive sat in one and yeah acceleration is fast but i didnt feel anything for it. a couple years ago i got into what would be my mk2 ford focus st for a test drive. the 5 pot sound, feeling part of the car as you change gears and the torque steer made that car feel alive. an electric car out accelerates it by a mile but that old focus is my yard stick for a fun car. (yeah the fiesta st is good but the noise never did it for me)

as ive experienced more and more cars ive noticed newer cars dont feel as nice as older cars to drive. i owned a mk3 focus st and by the end i hated that car. the steering while accelerating was all over the place, i had people ask me ""why does it move around when you accelerate?"" and i said ""the steering has no feel on centre"". they didnt believe me until they drove it, even after about 10-15mins driving they werent able to stop it moving around under acceleration in a straight line. it was great in the corners but it annoyed me soo much that i couldnt ever use the straightline performance of the car.",@15DEAN1995,0,2024-04-10T22:39:41Z

"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats. It's your choice whether you want to accept it. Please read the whole text.

So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God's standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law. Since God is just, He can't let sin go just like that.

So is there any hope? Yes, there is. Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. 

The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus's, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.    See:  Romans 3:1 , Romans 3:23 , Romans 5:12 , Romans 6:23 , Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10 , Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 ,  Ephesians 1:7 , Colossians 1:20, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 .",@Ivann1005,0,2024-04-10T21:38:00Z

"It's kind of pathetic really. A Ford Model T that's over a hundred years old has only lost about 10% of its' range.

I'm not so sure I agree with Matt on them being a good value for used cars either compared to internal combustion ones. I think for the most part it's about even. Assuming two of similar size and price are for sale, think of the pros and cons. 

The electric car does have less moving parts to worry about where the engine/motor is concerned, no cooling system to worry about, and, in most areas, will cost less to power than internal combustion vehicle of similar size.

The internal combustion car will have most of its' original range for longer trips, actually cost less to power in areas with high electricity prices, and weight is a big factor. The lighter weight of the internal combustion car means less stress on the tires, drivetrain, and suspension parts, all of which will last longer and thus, over time, cost less to replace.

They should be about equal in other areas like if your engine blows/battery pack dies, it costs about the same to replace, and crash damage would also be about the same. Thanks to new studies, we're also finding out that environmental impact is actually closer too, as while electric cars don't have the tailpipe emissions of internal combustion cars, they do have more pollution in terms of construction, disposal, and residuals like wearing rubber from tires.

As to safety, that's about even too. Teslas are super safe not because of their electric powertrain but because of how they're built. Tesla could build an internal combustion version and still be super safe. In addition, as we've seen from many videos, a bad wreck can still cause a fire just like in an internal combustion one.",@tenpoundburrito,0,2024-04-10T17:05:33Z

Worth pointing out that this car is probably the worst case scenario. It has a small battery so it's probably been fast charged a lot. It has no temperature management so the battery gets hot when fast charging which degrades the battery and because it's so small it's probably been at 100% charge ver often which is even worse for the battery.,@NorwayChallenge,1,2024-04-10T13:26:18Z

"~10 years old, 45k miles and only useful for a school run or a short commute. 
Remember that wasn't on predominantly faster roads, in rain or overly cold either so it will be worse as those factors are added. 
On top of that its got mould in it so welcome to a load of respiratory issues if you use it much and it still needs insurance, somewhere to park it and all the rest like any other car. 
There are plug-in hybrids with better range so its hard to see a use case for this thing unless you really want a car but never drive much more than about 30 miles and don't mind paying all the running costs for something with a similar usability to a golf cart. 
By contrast a cheap ice may well be in similar condition and have similar mileage but it will work as a car which can go where you like when you like. 
Even the old line about it being cheap to run is nonsense because it can't do enough mileage to make enough difference in fuel costs compared to an ice to even pay for its own insurance.",@siraff4461,10,2024-04-10T13:21:57Z

"Secondhand EVs are even MORE of a concern than your usual Petrol/Diesel car! You still have your mechanical worries like brakes, CVs, driveshafts, wheel bearings, wheels n tyres etc Then you also have even more electrical issues. But the much, MUCH bigger worry of a ruined battery and a ruined battery will pretty much write the car off! This car is super low mileage for its age (I'd guess previous owners were old farts?) But the battery on this is clearly knackered! 50 miles on a full charge is shite! So a car like this will only be worth it if you NEVER do any long journeys and just use it to pootle into town here n there and can have the car on charge on your drive constantly. If you don't have a driveway and can't park near your house then these are utter SHITE and that's without kids and drunks pulling the charging lead out for a laugh! Plus you can guarantee that as soon as the majority make the switch to crappy EVs then the government will whack up the tax on electricity and dramatically increase EV road tax prices.

"to the guys who are anti EV after seeing this video:
1. this car and all other japanese, european are bad at producing EV. Only tesla and chinese manufacturers know how to build cheap and good EVs.
2. This was 1st mass produced car, which had bad technology from the start (chademo, no cooling/heating battery, bad chemistry)
3. Today, chinese car shows that you can achieve 350-800 km, super fast charges on one charge, and very low degradation
4. CATL biggest battery manufacturer says that their battery will be cheaper (around 3k usd, not 7k like now) and they are now selling batteries for busses with 1-1,5 mln kilometres without degradation. 
So we need to remember that japanese/european offer is quite bad, overpriced tech. 
Plus this is 10 years old car. The good thing there are niche caompanies giving second life to these cars, on is putting bigger used battery (there is a video where guy put the biggest 62 and has around 400+km of range and is driving on highway) the second companies are doing custom batteries with cooling/heating technology around batteries, giving them better condition and range)

Plus I'm really shocked with the price 1500 gbp? In Poland one of moto-youtubers are selling his family car nissan, with maybe slighlty better battery condition for around 7k gbp.
So for 1500 gbp you can get ev + you can pay 10k euro for changing the battery for bigger one in Netherland and for around 15k you might have EV doing 350-420 km on one charge.

"If it was real 60 miles, it wouldn't be so bad, but it's not really. You can't drive around until you break down, so you need to leave yourself a 20% margin. That means a range <48 miles.

My regular commute is 32 miles. I used to have high hopes of getting a used electric car as my next car, but it seems like a scary proposition in that context.
