But yes chademo is kind of on the way out with chargers transitioning to NACS in the next few years. They don't have room for NACS, CCS and Chademo at charging stations.

It was the lowest cost EV (new or used) with the range to get my wife to work and back even if we experience extreme battery degradation even in the middle of winter.

For us it was as if the bolt didn't exist; we looked all over and couldn't get one, whereas every Nissan dealer in our greater metro area had multiple leafs on the lot.  People who ordered new bolts from the factory were reporting wait times that went past the end of production.

"Can you sell your Leaf?

I know it's a harsh question.

Only reason I ask is even here in California, I noticed it's harder to find a Chademo charger. CCS is more common and sometimes, the only chademo charger at a location is down.

I guess the closest EV with the similar price point would be the Chevy Bolt; however, looks like Chevy changed their mind again and are discontinuing it soon.

Also, Japanese brands for EV's right now are not good because they're behind in technology with other EV's especially charging speeds. 

I was a Toyota and Honda fan until I test drove the Bolt and ID4. 

I used to work at a Japanese company and while I'm generalizing, I started to observe other Japanese manufacturers and realized how behind in technology they are.

In November 2022, we actually sat in all models of a 2022 Toyota and noticed they used the same radio for each car, suv and the Sienna. 

At that time, the radio looked dated and the dashboard was using an almost monochrome color.

Then we sat in a Bolt and felt like we were in the future. Then we sat in an ID4 and realized that no, we weren't in the future. We were in 2022 and that the Toyota's were just outdated. 

I think they finally changed their tech in 2023; however, from the Japanese company I used to work for, I remember their culture as being reactive to the world and not being innovative. 

Hence why you see other non-Japaness companies inventing EV's sooner that have 200+ miles in range along with cool tech.

Besides the leaf, the 2nd BEV that came out of Japan was a joint venture with toyota and subaru to make the bz4 EV that charges faster than a leaf, but slower than all EV's in its class.

Right now, used EV's are selling for the $20k's.",rbetterkids,1,2024-01-14T12:11:50Z

"Highly agree. 

I didn't go with the leaf because of its low range. 

For me, I learned of accurate range when we previously owned a 2013 Prius plugin.

Kia dealership tried to sell me a $5,000 market adjustment on top of the lease deal I was going to settle for an SV+ and actually filled out the financing application and was going to return the next day to pick it up.

That night I was doing a bit more research and started getting cold feet when I found out about Chademo going obsolete.  Then, despite my mid 700s credit score, they rejected me for 0% financing which I took as a sign.  I was also able to find another Kia dealership through Costco that was willing to sell without a markup and got the Niro I really wanted.

TBH, the Nissan would have been a better financial decision, I‚Äôm paying roughly $300 a month more for the Kia than I would have for the Nissan and we have an Outback for road trips.

"Wow. Glad things worked out the way they did. Glad you followed your intuition.

For me, it started with the catalytic converter getting stolen from our Prius and it cost $2,800 to replace with a 3 month waiting time. Our neighbors got their catalytic converters stolen too, so we knew this would be a normal thing.

So we naturally went to several Toyota dealerships to check out the Sienna hybrid. The sales manager at where we bought a Prius told me he wasn't taking anymore reservations and the wait time then was 1 year minimum. 

So we test drove a 2021 and I noticed the User Interface was a monochrome color of green and black.

We then compromised to looking at a Highlander, Rav4, Corolla, and noticed they all used the same stereo.

So we went to a Toyota dealership near home where the sales guy wanted $60k for a 2021 Sienna. I laughed in his face and pointed at a used Model Y and told him, ""If I'm spending $60k, why not buy a new Model Y?"" 

Then the sales guy had like an oh sh!t look in his face, like what I said made sense.

That's when we test drove a Bolt EUV and ID4 AWD Pro and realized how dated Toyota's have been. They're reliable and serve their function; however, considering how other competitors were making their cars' UI more flashy, I felt like it was time for change.

I had been researching EV's since 2019, so this purchase was no impulse and more like a timing thing with the catalytic converter issue triggering it.",rbetterkids,2,2024-01-14T18:09:24Z

"EV Road Trips take planning, EV Charging stations are not as ubiquitous as gasoline stations.

I now have a 2024 Nissan Leaf SV plus and I also have made the trip with a non-plus model, the non-plus is much more difficult. I use applications like ChargePoint, and it‚Äôs check-in comments, A Better Route Planner (ABRP), Leaf Spy Pro (requires a OBD2 dongle, I use the CARISTA one). I also have learned to call the charging network provider when on my way and ask them if the ChaDeMo is up, and if not make alternative charging plans.  When I had a non-plus I charged using J1772 at camp grounds and at hotels too. I still carry a long 25 foot heavy duty (10 AWG) outdoor rated extension cord to use with my EVSE charging cord, to use in a pinch, if needed.

Teslas can use J1722 with an adapter, and most Tesla non-Supercharger stations like you might have in a garage could be used by a Leaf with an adapter which costs around $150. So if Bolts are charging in your condo you should have no problem with a Leaf.",Lowley_Worm,1,2022-05-18T02:56:46Z
"In a word: Yes

I'm an original owner of a 2011, and now I also own a 2022 Plus model. I live in Florida so warm/hot but not Arizona hot. It will not be ""out of commission"" any time soon.

Only Teslas charge on the Tesla network, as Tesla designed and built it. Teslas can use public chargers with an adapter. Basic information but I had to learn so hopefully helpful to people new to electric vehicles:

L1 is 120 volt, maybe 5 miles / hour charging, so slow but you can plug into a regular outlet

L2 is 240 volt, maybe 33 miles / hour charging, so much quicker  but you must use a 240 volt charger, either at home or a public charger.

L3 is 480 volt, incredibly fast, but those chargers are less common. Back in 2012 of course extremely rare.  So the L3 has evolved, or devolved depending, think of beta vs vhs. The LEAF uses CHADEMO, which is going the way of beta, even though it is superior (IMHO as V2G is possible), in favor of CCS. Nissan has given up on CHADEMO with their new EV. This is a legitimate concern, but really more so if somebody plans on taking long trips, in which case they buy a Tesla and are very happy and have gotten real value for the higher price. It will still be possible to find CHADEMO QCs for many years, and I survived back in 2012 when there were very few and far between.

The LEAF also has air-cooled batteries, done for cost cutting, and some consider a deal-breaker. In my opinion not ruinous for battery life. The 2011 first batch batteries were terrible, but Nissan improved, and replaced the pack on the 2011 back in 2017, down 15% in five years and 52K miles. So a decision to purchase a LEAF does depend on the buyer's location, and even I would advise somebody in Phoenix to consider an alternative.

I think it is an excellent car, with fine and adequate quality at a price that I could justify. The federal $7500 tax credit is also applicable so that was a factor for my calculations too. Unfortunately the federal government has chosen to marginalize many average people by not allowing the unused credit to be carried forward. Nissan used to cut the full $7500 tax credit through to the lessee, but they don't do this anymore, but that is how I was able to afford the 2011 LEAF.

An alternative to a new LEAF would be a used one, and then the $7500 tax credit should already have been factored into the price.",sub3marathonman,11,2022-01-23T17:38:56Z
"They are quite reliable and overall a very good EV, however they do have a shortfall. The battery has no thermal management which means you cannot do extensive road trips; you will not be able to continually drive and charge.

Overall the car is a crazy good city car. Home/workplace charging renders the car ridiculously useful. You can charge it at home or at any commercial L2 charger (J1772 plug, like every other EV). It's equipped with a CHAdeMO quick charge port (one of two existing competing ports, the other being CCS). CHAdeMO appears to be slowly phasing out but otherwise will still be around for a while. Regardless, due to the battery limitation you should not consider quick charging a part of your regular use.",rusnug,8,2022-01-23T17:35:53Z
"I bought a new 2021 SL Plus June of 2021. Installed a level 2 charger in my garage. Car is great, very comfortable, heat pump and other heat sources work very well in temps hovering in the teens.

"Nissan Leaf is a reliable vehicle and has been sold for many years.  

The main complaints about the Nissan Leaf are:

1.  It uses an older, slower ‚Äúfast charging‚Äù connection called CHaDeMo.  CHaDeMo tops out at 50kwh vs newer chargers that can go up to 350 kwh.  Faster kwh speeds mean quicker charging times.

2.  The battery is air-cooled.  It does not have a system to manage the battery at optimal temperature. 

3.  Fast charging causes lots of heat, so without a cooling system, the battery will age sooner vs a liquid cooled battery EV.

4. The interior is not the most up to date.  It does offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, though. 

Having said all that, the Leaf IS a good car.  It is the most affordable EV on the market and it will give you many years of reliable service.  You will probably be tired of the car before it is tired of you. You can still buy the it new and qualify for $7500 in federal tax incentives plus state tax incentives.

Look at PlugShare to find chargers near you.  You can use Level 1 (regular plug) Level 2, and Level 3 (CHaDeMo) chargers. 

https://abetterrouteplanner.com/ can help you see how owning the Nissan Leaf will fit into where you want to go! They also offer an app.

I would take the Nissan Leaf over any ICE car, any day. (Okay, maybe not a Ferrari or Lamborghini, but almost any lol).  Maintenance and running costs will be far less.

"I did my research on the leaf, didn‚Äôt end up with one but via an extended test drive and online reviews (both pro and user) it does stack up as a huge value with great reliability.

Unfortunately, it does use chademo fast charging, if so equipped, which is basically a terminally I‚Äôll standard now. Most states aren‚Äôt even installing new chargers. Non-Tesla vehicles have all gotten behind the CCS standard.

You can still charge at home and at other locations using the highly available level 2 standard j-1772 plugs. They just charge much slower. Fine if you‚Äôre at work for 8 hours or parked overnight at home but not great if you‚Äôre in a road trip.

"There are two main things you need to know about a leaf before you can decide if it's a good car for you:

1) Most leafs from 2011-2017 will have moderate to severe battery degradation. This is a problem specifically with the leafs, and basically means their batteries lost capacity much more quickly than most cars. A 2011 leaf might have only 25-45 miles of range depending on driving conditions. Later leafs are better about this.

2) It will not be a road trip car. The leaf has ""fast"" charging, but it won't be suitable for taking longer trips, because of the battery degradation issues, and because of the way the leaf fast charges. The battery in the leaf has no cooling method, which means it can't charge at a fast charger very fast or more than once or twice a day.

If you only need reliable transportation for short (<35 mile) round trips in town, I'd say go for it. If you need more range or to take longer trips frequently, the leaf is not for you.",Cobiathan,2,2022-01-23T17:15:21Z

Picture it if you were using your smartphone for a full charge within 2 hours, then recharge it once, then drain it again except this time it won't charge well anymore. So now you have to wait a long while for it to recharge (recharge #2). Then you drain it again.

"The first generation Soul EV definitely has issues in hot climates in my experience. Ours had its original battery replaced at 40k miles due to degradation (down to about 60% capacity), and is probably in need of another now about 65k miles later (~60-65% capacity). Ours is a 2015, but I've heard of others having similar issues with MY 2016 and 2017 as well.

Ours was doing fine on the replaced battery pack until we hit about 105k miles, then it rapidly dropped over a period of a couple weeks from about 80 miles per charge to where we're at now with about 50-55 miles per charge. It's been holding steady at that level for several months now, but Soul EV Spy consistently reports that one cell is at ~48% degradation so idk how long this will last.

Ford used 10% of the battery capacity as low/high buffer, while competitors use less than half that. That's driving up the cost of the vehicle a few thousand right there.

"Congratulations! And thank you for choosing an EV!

The one bit of advice I have is that a level 2 charger (i.e. 240V, with a dedicated electrical circuit) is nice, but depending on how far you drive every day, may be optional.

Figure that with the provided level 1 charger (""Portable Charge Cable""), you'll recharge around 3.5 miles/hr (120V * 12A * 1hr = 1440 Wh * 1 mile / 400 Wh = 3.6 miles).

If you can charge 10 hours a day on average, that's 13,000 miles per year. 12 hours a day is almost 16,000 miles.

"The leaf is a very good car however the battery is sub-optimal nowadays. Not me shitting on you, because that doesn't make it a bad purchase. However, I'd advise if you want to preserve range that you limit how often you road trip and fast charge with it, as well as limit charge to 80% unless before road tripping. Driving in extreme cold and extreme heat is probably not a great idea either due to the unideal cooling system.

 Now if you plan on getting rid of it after a while, fuck it, ball out. But if this is meant to last I'd recommend preserving that battery.

"Tesla's can actually charge at 150kW+ multiple times a day. Leafs can charge at no more than 50kW, and they can't do that more than once a day, due to the battery cooling system being really anemic. Any subsequent attempts to fast-charge will be severely slowed down to keep the battery from frying itself.

So in a Tesla with a 250 mile range, you can spend ~20-30 minutes at a charger every 3-4 hours. With a Leaf, you have to spend at least 45 minutes at the first one, and more than an hour at all the rest.",coredumperror,15,2022-10-10T05:47:03Z

"Yes. *All* battery displays are the same. 

There is no single ""true 100%"" level on li-ion batteries. As you stuff more power in you're just shortening the lifetime and, eventually, increasing the risk of combustion.

The ""100%"" level is of course always set well before the point where it would become dangerous. But below that you (as a manufacturer) do a calculation where you estimate how many charging cycles you want the battery to take in its lifetime, then add a bit of margin. That's your ""100%"".

If you're a serious manufacturer (or work in a heavily regulated Industry or market) you estimate total cycles for the practical lifetime of the product. Cars are like that. So are medical devices.

If you care about range and efficiency keep the tire pressure high. Play around between the sticker and sidewall PSI to find what works best for you.

When you replace the tires eventually be sure to buy tires that are rated for efficiency. Most efficient to least efficient tires could be a 20% difference in range.

I'm not saying use these exact numbers - sometimes its longer between chargers and sometimes ir shorter. But the mentality is charge when you can, not when you have to.

Its better to drive shorter stints between with many small charge stops then one long stint with one large charge stop.

Bonus is also it keeps you fresher as a driver as you get more frequent breaks.",Fachuro,2,2022-10-10T11:39:49Z
"Actually no, because the charging effect is not linear and starts dropping off after the first few minutes - which negates the time spent driving on/off an exit ramp to get to the charger.

In many cases chargers deliver up to double the effect in the first 5 minutes compared to what they do in the consequent 45 minutes to get from 20-80%.

Cars also have a limiter placed that further significantly limits charging from 0-10/0-20 and 80-100/90-100 depending on the car - which is done to preserve battery health.

However this further cements the idea of charge when you can, not when you have to. Its an adapted charging culture in Norway because it havent always been this developed with fast chargers, and those chargers need to support a larger amount of EVs too. Also some areas are not as well supported.

If you charge whenever possible its also less range anxiety if theres a sudden long stretch without chargers.

We also have idealistic organizations that have built charging maps that show availability for all available chargers regardless of company running it throughout the country.

Also keep in mind we have a violent terrain so range often is affected by going over mountains or undersea tunnels.

"Your car is likely good for everything but distance.  I know ChADeMO is problematic, and the charging is slow on that Nissan (ChADeMO is always limited to 50 KW from my experience)

I literally switched from an Ioniq Electric Limited (2021, NOT THE IONIQ 5, that is a different car) to a Mustang Mach E ER AWD (2022) because of range issues.  Waiting 50 min twice to fast charge between DC and NYC was a pain.  Luckily, chargers were iat least available everywhere (ie: CCS not ChADeMO)  What I‚Äôm reading here about only being able to dc fast charge every 12 hours, along with only having ChADeMO, makes the leaf sound even worse.  The leaf is also less efficient per kWh on the highway than the original Ioniq electric, plus I have never seen a 150 KW ChADeMO charger in the northeast corridor.  So you‚Äôd probably charge more at the dc fast charger to go that distance.  Only saving grace vs even the Ioniq you have there is a bigger battery (therefore you can leave your starting point with more range, which may negate the charging requirements).

Nice color though :).  If you don‚Äôt need to drive far, that is 100% a good buy!

"The Leaf is about $22k after the federal tax credit, more if there are state tax credits too. The battery data is pretty uncertain since it's expected to last at least 8-10 years and even the first Leaf drivers have only had it for four, but I was at a conference on battery technology and saw a study that in the majority of cases, they're degrading more slowly than expected (with some notable exceptions in places with extreme climates). Obviously the paybacks are a lot shorter when gas was $4 a gallon as opposed to now, but total cost of ownership for a Leaf is still pretty comparable to an ICE even at current gas prices.

Plug-in hybrids like the Volt, on the other hand, really aren't at the break-even point except in places with the most generous incentives or drivers who make an effort to manage their charging really well. Those still make more sense on a lease, but as costs come down and volumes come up, that technology will probably get there too.",BreadstickNinja,1,2015-03-22T02:27:30Z

"Oh man,  haha sounds like we both had headaches! Mine was a 1998 GT I bought used.  I should have known I was in for a tough time when two weeks after I bought it third gear went out.  (it was a 5 speed manual)  Luckily that was replaced under warranty at the dealership.  

Later on during a routine oil change the idiots didn't put oil in it, didn't notice anything wrong until I was half way home and it started knocking something fierce.  Drove it for two weeks before they could replace the engine.  

Had a brake line blow on me at 50 mph when a deer ran out in front of me.  After fixing the brake line,  the return fuel line got a nasty leak while I was at work,  covered the parking lot in gasoline.  

One day it decided not to start.  The key would turn,  the lights came on,  everything seemed okay, just wouldn't start.  I tested the battery,  tested the starter,  all good there.  When I hooked the battery up after putting the starter back in the dash started smoking,  turns out the wiring in the ignition failed.  

The last straw was when the AC compressor seized up.  I found a used one at a junk yard,  installed it and traded the damn thing for a 2000 VW Beetle.  

There were other things that broke but I can't think of them right now,  that car was a nightmare.   A combination of shitty engineering and bad luck,  that was the worst four years of my life.  I hate that car with a passion.  ",edgemaster191,2,2015-03-21T21:12:29Z

"Oh... exactly. Different problems and all but the same shit.

One weird thing and I pretty much think I'm anticursed or something because this shit happens often... the power steering fluid leaked ferociously so I kept adding more and eventually ran out, didn't have money but a neighbor had some. I put in different power steering fluid and out of nowhere I didn't have a power steering leak anymore.

Same car had a coolant leak and I occasionally forgot to check it before or after work. One time ran coolant completely out and when I parked the hood felt like it was on fire (heat radiating off that you could feel as soon as you opened the door). I poured water in (it was summer time) and waited a few minutes then started her up. No issues before or after.

Had the car stall on me (it was Auto) and thought ""oh, just shut up and get me home so I can scrap you, God damn piece of shit"". Hit neutral, hit key and it roared its weak offensive snarl back to life. Never stalled again.

That car knew I hated it and it knew I actively hoped to sell it for scrap when I got rid of it. Sadly it was worth far too much when I finally decided I couldn't afford three vehicles.

Sold for $700 after getting a $700 insurance check (see my post history titled something like ""not bad for first time"").

>The real problem lies in how that power is being generated, which alongside industrial waste accounts for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions.


But if you are building or buying an electric ""because it's better for the environment"" (which yes I that it is) why would you then go and build a 300hp car?


It's like if you wanted to help the environment by not eating meat so you decided to have the best vegetables flown in from Italy or something. Making the whole effort a farce.


>Reforming our power grid and cracking down on waste will be the real hurdles here,


But until that happens, manufacturing a 300hp electric car is taking a solution (electric cars) and making it as least effective as possible (making them use lots of energy - which mainly comes from non-renewable sources) in impacting the problem.


Using an electric car is a good thing. Making that electric car as powerful as possible is directly counterproductive to the whole goal of electric vehicles.

"I‚Äôve owned a LEAF for 6 years and it has never done anything wrong. Even the battery is holding up OK at 81% SOH and it meets out daily city needs. My wife uses it mostly and she loves it. I also have a Tesla Model 3 and here‚Äôs where the LEAF has done significant damage to the reputation of EVs. 

The Model 3 is pushing 3 years old and the battery is still sitting at 98% of original capacity but every time anyone asks me about it they always jump to the argument that the battery will need replacing and that‚Äôs going to cost a fortune. Based on mileage and the very minor degradation, it looks like my pack will be well above 90% for the next decade but the public perception is that batteries degrade rapidly and need replacing. The LEAF did that. However, there‚Äôs a company here in NZ that is developing a thermally managed LFP replacement pack for old LEAFs since Nissan doesn‚Äôt support them here or sell replacement batteries so with one of those the issue with go away entirely. And yet, still, the cretins driving huge utes and paying $3 a litre still believe the batteries are dirtier because ‚Äúyou have to throw them away after three years‚Äù (thanks Jeremy Clarkson, that‚Äôs on you)

I don‚Äôt hate the LEAF, it was a compromise at the time and aftermarket solutions will keep the car relevant and reliable for many years to come but there‚Äôs no denying that the air-cooled battery Nissan used has done significant damage to the reputation of EVs.",EVMad,25,2022-02-17T18:55:43Z
"Yep 

We have 2 EVs:. A 2015 Leaf and a 2017 Bolt.

Leaf has 11 bars, roughly 85% of its battery per Leaf Spy.

Bolt had 99% of its battery last New Years, per Torque Pro, the day before I got a brand new battery in it.

The kicker?  The Bolt was a lease return buy.  It was left on a car lot in the middle of summer for 4 months without being plugged in.  It had one cell fail, and I had that module replaced.

Both cars have about 55,000 miles on them.

A lot of this is due to chemistry, but some it is due to battery cooling - it regularly gets over 100F here in the summer, for months at a time.  The Bolts battery air conditioner will be chugging away, while the Leaf almost redlined just sitting in the shade for 3 days at 117F.

Some it is also due to the fact that the bolt has a software charge setting where you can limit your charging to 90%.  I'm convinced that it helps prevent degradation in hot weather, most bolt owners keep it on.

Finally, that being said, the newer leafs have better battery chemistry and are pretty solid cars.  They don't catch on fire, which has been an ongoing problem with many of the other EV models (Kona, Bolt, Tesla, etc).",PersnickityPenguin,2,2022-02-18T05:15:17Z

EVs Enhanced are building the pack and have a video on YouTube about their pack design. Internally it is entirely different from Nissan‚Äôs setup and they‚Äôre talking about LFP and NMC based packs with the latter hitting 75kWh capacity. They haven‚Äôt stated the exact size of the smallest pack but I would be surprised if it wasn‚Äôt at least 40kWh and I‚Äôm hoping for 50 as that makes most sense to me. An LFP pack doesn‚Äôt mind being charged to 100% all the time and with thermal management it should last a very long time.,EVMad,5,2022-02-18T06:12:35Z
The nature of aftermarket improvements to cars almost a decade old is that they will be adaptations of what is already there. When the Leaf was designed the battery pack was designed to be essentially sealed due to the unfounded worries at the time that EVs could not cope in wet weather. Some compromising in that sealing to (say) divert AC air across the battery back would seem the most sensible solution. Use what is already in the car - a functioning passenger heating/cooling system.,Legitimate_Finger_69,2,2022-02-18T03:26:40Z

"I have a gen 2 - 2018 - it's my only car. It is great for the vast majority of driving I do within my city and the area around it. However, any trip over 100 km away where highway travel is involved is a challenge, particularly in winter. With planning, and preparation, I can travel 250km from my home, but that entails two DCFC stops.   


A first gen ID4, or MME, or any Tesla, or pick a brand, is better at handling a longer journey. It's this edge case that freaks people out. I could easily spend a lot less for an ICE of the same year, and comfortably drive x-country. I can't with my Leaf.   


The disconnect between price and ability are why it's dumped on. That said, it's the best car I've ever had, for some cases of best. Alas, not all cases, as I do like to go on long journeys. They'll just have to be slower :-S",cdnincali,8,2022-02-17T18:15:11Z

"The truth is of course, in the UK, most people seldom drive beyond the abilities of even the 24kWh Leaf on a daily basis. For most people almost every day they drive around, plug in, have a full tank of ""fuel"" every morning.

For almost any ICE driver, if you offered them half price fuel BUT they had to stop every 90 minutes to get it, they'd bite your hand off and queue around the block. Only in electric vehicles is it a massive hassle to plug in, get a coffee and then drive off WHEN you could sit in a queue for 20 minutes for your half price fuel, REFILL AND PAY IN 5 MINUTES SUPER QUICK FTW and then drive off again.

That's the point that is missed. Around here there are free rapid chargers, plus overnight home charging is 5p per kWh - almost free. If sold petrol for 10p/litre there would be gridlock for kilometres around but with a Leaf you can get it by 10 seconds of time plugging in on your driveway.

Additionally, I can't charge at home yet (condo), and there are few free chargers around - though I do use them when I can. 

You're right, if you offered reduced energy ICE drivers would jump even with inconveniences. I don't find my car inconvenient, except when it is. ;) They're different annoyances than with an ICE car, and when I finally get a charger I'll have fewer. A LEAF is a good car. Alas, detractors like to oatch onto its differences rather than its positives. It's the best winter car I've had that wasn't 4wd.

I have a level 2 24amp charger at home and its enough that we never have to worry about if we need to worry about charging, but the furthest from home we drive is less than 50 miles.

"I have been driving my 13 since 15. It has close to 100k miles on it. When I bought it my plan was to use this as a commuter car and rent when I wanted to go further. What I did not realize is that further is not really that far if your local charging network is terrible along with degradation. 

For example, I live in a town West of Orlando. If I want to drive say to MCO to pick up someone and come right home I cannot do that on one charge considering the trip is about 30 miles one way. Now if there were a set of rapid chargers near the airport, or even at the airport this would alleviate this issue. However, there is not and so I have to have a second car for things like this. Thus you have to automatically be a two car household in what I would say are most areas. I also think that there are some that are annoyed that Nissan dealerships have had issues with their rapid chargers being available, or even working. IMO, this alone should tell you Nissan's value for their EV market. 

If I could go back in time to when I was making my purchase I probably would steer away from the Leaf due to degradation, lack of support from the dealerships, lack of charging infrastructure and I would have just purchased a two year old hybrid.

"I found mine by chance shopping for any EV/Hybrid about a month ago and I was shocked I could afford an EV.  (I think the low cost was also because that city didn't tend to support EVs, it was dinged up in the back from a minor fender bender, and it didn't come with the home charger.)

Relavent to this post, I did some research before contacting the dealership but everything I saw told me the Leaf was a dependable car that might have issues due to lack of thermal control on the batteries.  Weather here is pretty temperate.  It seemed to me, from the general perception of the Leaf, that this was a killer deal I had to go for.  I didn't really see any vitriol but maybe that's because I wasn't looking in communities tailored to EVs but doing general Google/YouTube/etc. searches. 

My Leaf isn't a second car, so time will tell if I get fed up with the lack of range/features.  So far, I'm having zero issues.  I use it to commute to work which is only a few miles.  I did a test a couple days ago on the limits (so it's 100% on me for being stupid) and I ended up almost stranded only 170 Wh of usable battery left according to LEAF Spy because it was really cold out.  (I could've charged 30 miles before that so it was my fault.)  I do know there's a place in Portland that will be able to upgrade my battery so that's a possible future fix.  My current lifestyle doesn't need road trips but it'd be cool to know that I *could* do one.

Feature wise, the 2015 Leaf S has no GPS and audio has to be through the aux port.  I'll likely have to buy a Garmin or similar and I've already put a phone mount for using LEAF Spy and GPS, but my phone died on that test trip and you can probably imagine how it is being bad at directions and lost in a city with no GPS/phone.

I can see why people would hate on it and look past all the positives of it, but I think we as humans tend to gravitate more towards the negatives.  Most people also try to find things that agree with their worldview and ignore what doesn't, which isn't going to help when it's based on false ideas like thinking people throw away EV batteries into landfills every couple years.",Kairu-san,2,2022-02-17T20:38:19Z

"I think Leaf is still relevant in 2022.  I got new SV 40 KW about 2 weeks ago after trading in my 2015 Nissan Rogue.  For me it's a perfect car to drive as a daily commuter. I don't care about fast charging since most of my driving is around town. I come home and charge it overnight when needed. For long trips we will use our Mazda CX 5. People tend to over buy things assuming they will use them in the future. Why do I need to carry extra weight of 62 KW battery if I drive less than 30 miles a day? Why do I need fast charge if I can go to sleep and have ""full tank of gas"" in the morning? And just in case, Nissan Leaf still has fast charging capability... and oh, the price ! it's going to be around $20K after federal tax credit and state rebate (Oregon) so to me, the 2022 Nissan Leaf is not outdated...",rgold220,8,2022-02-17T19:44:50Z
I bought one last week. It was between that and the ID.4 (Niro and Kona aren‚Äôt available in my area). The iD 4 was going to have a 5k markup with a 2 month wait and base model. My cheaper Leaf SL Plus luckily arrived a month earlier than it was scheduled to. It did have an $1800 markup but included a lifetime warranty on the car minus the battery pack. So far I love it and have no regrets.

We got a tekna (top of the range in the UK?) For just over 30k on a very low interest rate. Imo it's the best decent sized Ev on the market. Sure other companies are bringing out their own Evs but the leaf has been around an has been improved.

How big is your kid? That range in a Tesla is nicer and the super charger network is nice, but I would only be using that once a year maybe. It's not cost effective when I can just rent a car for a few hundred dollars. Would I like to rent a Tesla instead of an ICE car? Yes. Hopefully that will be a thing soon. There is not one car that is going to fit every need. The Leaf fills a big need for everyday car for people who have a home place to charge it and don't have or want a big car budget. When we got it, the area I live in, it was between a Leaf or a Bolt. The Bolt didn't have the $7500 credit anymore and the batteries were in the news for catching fire.

What they did instead were sheet-metal upgrades and ditched the heat-stable battery formulation in favor of higher capacity options.

But given the difference in price the build quality can be forgiven. The biggest issue for me is how it works as an EV, the id4 has made design choices in regards to how it handles regen and B mode which in practice make for a much better driving experience.

This is why I don't fear for mechanics one bit. Of course EVs will kill the repair business. But they'll create a custom business.

The local garage down the road will have some shells/cages with the vehicle. They'll slide in a battery back, put a motor or motors at the wheels, you'll order the interior you want and it'll go in simply and in an industry standard, modular fashion.

"You can crack the code all you want, there is a ton of hardware protection baked in the inverter. The hardware protection will always react a lot faster than the software, so you rarely rely entirely on software for Overcurrent/Overvoltage protections.

So unless you tweak that current measurement circuit, the system will either shut down the switching, open the main contactor, go in limp home, or limit the torque.

Traction inverter are safety critical, so because of ISO26262, there's going to be a lot of protection and redundancy built in the system.

Not saying it's impossible, but it's not just software. Plus, I know there's quite a lot of margin when they design the inverters, but they're very temp sensitive, your power modules (and motor) will literally die if you don't cool them properly.

Your best bet is to replace the whole inverter, as long as you keep an eye on your motor temperatures, you should be fine.

"To them the $43k is irrelevant. When I sold cars I didn't care if you were buying a $43k Ram or a $23k Dodge Dart. The money is in the profit margin. If they weren't going to make enough over margin than its not worth it. I had a guy who wanted a very specific Jeep Cherokee. Refused to order one, wanted it now. The only one in 1000 miles was in Missouri ( I'm in Michigan).  There was no way in hell we were paying to get it unless he paid transport costs which he refused. He went to another dealer and they got it for him because they needed it to hit their number sold for the month to get manufacturer incentives. Which are really how all the dealers are making money now. It's about volume to get your unit bonus.

But it sometimes comes down to the salesman. I had agreed to purchase a Toyota RAV4 for my wife. We had settled on a black on in stock.  My wife called them the day before pickup and asked if they had a purple one (she saw the color available online) which they didn't.

"This is one key benefit of the multi dealership car buying services. Instead of having to pay dealer transfer costs when one dealership has a vehicle and once a couple hundred bucks for shipping it to another dealership, this service offered by your local credit union or Costco will approach all the dealerships in your area and potentially farther to see who might have a vehicle that fits your specs and wants to sell it at a price you are willing to accept.

I bought two cars like this and have recommended friends who used this similar services to get three more and in every case, the process was much smoother. 


The dealers pay the service a small fee because they bring them volume but they are not paying an individual salesperson a commission which is usually more than the search company's fee.

You order the car from the website, and pay a relatively small non-refundable deposit. They walk you through the financing and all the other tidbits through your Tesla account. Then you choose whether to schedule a time to take delivery at a nearby location (if something nearby exists) or opt to have them literally drop it off to you... which doesn't have to even be your home. 

I think the best part is that there is no haggling or swindling attempts by a dealership franchise. The price is the price at the time of your online order, and that's it.

"I used to make the mistake of thinking that the auto mfg and the dealership were the same.

But now I equate a car maker like Ford, GM, or Toyota to a computer builder like Apple, HP, or Dell. And the car dealership is the equivalent of an Best Buy or Office Depot.

But where supplying a Best Buy with 100 computers might cost $150k, supplying a dealership with 100 cars might cost $20 million. Car makers avoid inventory and don't need to have a nationwide sales network. Dealerships don't have to deal with manufacturing and can focus on local sales.

Dealerships hope you assume they and the car maker are closely aligned because it lends legitimacy to their repair services and extended warranties which are profit makers for them. 

The computer equivalent to Tesla would be computer online only manufacturers. Their ""dealer"" showrooms don't have any inventory for you to drive off the lot. Apple and Dell sell both to retailers and direct to consumer. And will have inventory for the most common models.

You can see it as fucking the dealership or see it as employing a rarely used option to secure other discounts and get yourself a better deal.

"I‚Äôve only had my EV for a few weeks and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it so far. The only thing that would stop me from buying one would be if I was regularly road tripping in certain rural areas. Sometimes charging infrastructure is straight up non-existent. 

I‚Äôve tried making plans to go to some small towns in middle of nowheresville, but it became dubious when I realized they have literally 1 charger, and it‚Äôs not even a fast one. With the nearest other charger 90 miles away, it becomes questionable, even with long range EVs. Those are fringe cases though, and if you‚Äôre on the east coast/west coast/near any major city, charging infrastructure is generally very good - especially if you go Tesla since they have their *very fast* supercharger network.

Why would they even think they needed a max payout clause in their extended warranty contract unless they knew they were selling junk?

"I think battery life and storage is part of the issue. Every battery I've ever owned degrades over time. From the smallest watch battery to a big car battery.

"EVs are still a bit ""bleeding edge"".  The batteries take up a lot of volume.  The only way to make them fit is to build batteries into unique custom shapes to mold into the features of that specific car.

More difficult is batteries keep changing.  Like, you might base the gen 1 on batteries made from 2,000 cells that are 18mm high and 65mm tall.  

2 years later, the engineering develops further, and they change electrode composition, do the math, and come up with a cell that is 21mm wide and 70mm tall and there's only 1,500 in a pack, it has more capacity, will last longer, and is cheaper to manufacture. But, there's no way to fit the new cells into a pack that fits the 2 yr old vehicle.

So now the older pack design isn't just about assembling the cells.  The ""gigafactor"" or whatever is switching over to the new higher performance, cheaper cells.  So it's hard to build the older packs, and it's not like the gearbox for a '88 Chevy- you can't make a bunch of extra in 1987 and keep them in a warehouse.  They have to be maintained and even then will degrade significantly over, say, 5-10 years of storage.  You're not going to recover a battery pack from a junked '88 car that just needs to be torn down and the clutch and bearings replaced and it's good as new.  The only option is mfgs need to make new ones.  There aren't many mfgs and the market it much hotter for making new batts with the newest tech, rather than making old battery designs for older cars.",Oznog99,2,2020-10-30T17:31:39Z
"Well I do understand the form factor issue, but if people had the option of NO battery and a useless shell of a car, or some type of aftermarket battery that may not have as much of a charge (say 60 miles instead of 80) that would still be useful.

I'd imagine as electric cars get more common there will be more aftermarket parts available.  Probably refurbishing cores from wrecked cars.   Same way you can go into an auto parts store and buy a rebuilt alternator or axle for cars now.  I think OEMs are only required by law to support cars for like 7-8 years.   Maybe batteries will always be so expensive that the car will be worth less than the battery ever will when they go bad.

"> **run the math** assuming you get 4 miles per Kw at your electricity price and see where you end up?

Don't mind if I do!

Average US electricity cost is 12 cents a KWh.   

Cost per KWh | Cost per mile | Cost per 20 miles | 30 miles | 40 miles
:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
$0.08| $0.02 |$0.40|$0.60|$0.80|
$0.12| $0.03 |$0.60|$0.90|$1.20
$0.16 |$0.04 |$0.80|$1.20|$1.60
$0.20| $0.05  |$1.00|$1.50|$2.00


@ $1.80 per gallon of gas you're paying 9 cents a mile if you get 20mpg, 6 cents a mile if you get 30 mpg, and 4.5 cents a mile if you get 40mpg.  You do save on maintenance with electric (less brake replacements, no oil changes) but may face a battery replacement near the 5-7 year point (or longer).  On the other side, gas is at a [near historic (adjusted for inflation) low](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/gasoline-prices-adjusted-for-inflation/), so the equation can only get better for electric cars.  

At the 100,000 mile mark (7-9 years for most) , gas cars also will have a few maintenance items due (transmission oil change, O2 sensors replaced if failing, new spark plugs, new fuel filter, throttle body cleanout, etc). 

Your electricity costs would have to be way over the average amount for gas to be cheaper.  Also there's the bonus of fueling up at home (saving a weekly or bi-weekly) gas stop.
